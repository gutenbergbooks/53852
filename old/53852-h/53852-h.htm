<span class="smaller">FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF ABOLITIONISTS.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Brookline</span>, Mass., <i>6 month, 12th, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>: Thy book has appeared just at
a time, when, from the nature of my engagements, it
will be impossible for me to give it that attention
which so weighty a subject demands. Incessantly occupied
in prosecuting a mission, the responsibilities of
which task all my powers, I can reply to it only by
desultory letters, thrown from my pen as I travel from
place to place. I prefer this mode to that of taking
as long a time to answer it, as thou didst to determine
upon the best method by which to counteract the effect
of my testimony at the north&mdash;which, as the preface
of thy book informs me, was thy main design.</p>

<p>Thou thinkest I have not been ‘sufficiently informed
in regard to the feelings and opinions of Christian females
at the North’ on the subject of slavery; for that
in fact they hold the same <em>principles</em> with Abolitionists,
although they condemn their measures. Wilt
thou permit me to receive their principles from thy
pen? Thus instructed, however misinformed I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
heretofore have been, I can hardly fail of attaining to
accurate knowledge. Let us examine them, to see
how far they correspond with the principles held by
Abolitionists.</p>

<p>The great fundamental principle of Abolitionists is,
that man cannot rightfully hold his fellow man as property.
Therefore, we affirm, that <em>every slaveholder is
a man-stealer</em>. We do so, for the following reasons:
to steal a man is to rob him of himself. It matters not
whether this be done in Guinea, or Carolina; a man
is a <em>man</em>, and <em>as</em> a man he has <em>inalienable</em> rights,
among which is the right to personal <em>liberty</em>. Now if
every man has an <em>inalienable</em> right to personal liberty,
it follows, that he cannot rightfully be reduced to slavery.
But I find in these United States, 2,250,000
men, women and children, robbed of that to which
they have an <em>inalienable</em> right. How comes this to
pass? Where millions are plundered, are there no
<em>plunderers</em>? If, then, the slaves have been robbed of
their liberty, <em>who</em> has robbed them? Not the man
who stole their forefathers from Africa, but he who
now holds them in bondage; no matter <em>how</em> they came
into his possession, whether he inherited them, or
bought them, or seized them at their birth on his own
plantation. The only difference I can see between
the original man-stealer, who caught the African in
his native country, and the American slaveholder, is,
that the former committed <em>one</em> act of robbery, while the
other perpetrates the same crime <em>continually</em>. Slaveholding
is the perpetrating of acts, all of the same kind,
in a <em>series</em>, the first of which is technically called man-stealing.
The <em>first</em> act robbed the man of himself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and the same state of mind that prompted <em>that act,
keeps up the series</em>, having <em>taken</em> his all from him: it
<em>keeps</em> his all from him, not only <em>refusing</em> to <em>restore</em>,
but still robbing him of all he gets, and as fast as he
gets it. Slaveholding, then, is <em>the constant or habitual
perpetration of the act of man-stealing. To make</em>
a slave is <em>man-stealing</em>&mdash;<em>the <span class="smcapuc">ACT</span> itself</em>&mdash;to <em>hold</em> him
such is man-stealing&mdash;the <em>habit</em>, the <em>permanent</em> state,
made up of <em>individual</em> acts. In other words&mdash;to <em>begin</em>
to hold a slave is man-stealing&mdash;to <em>keep on</em> holding
him is merely a <em>repetition</em> of the first act&mdash;a doing
the same identical thing <em>all the time</em>. A series of the
same acts continued for a length of time is a <em>habit</em>&mdash;<em>a
permanent state</em>. And the <em>first</em> of this series of the
<em>same</em> acts that make up this <em>habit</em> or state is just like
all the rest.</p>

<p>If every slave has a right to freedom, then surely
the man who withholds that right from him to-day is
a man-stealer, though he may not be the first person
who has robbed him of it. Hence we find that Wesley
says&mdash;‘Men-<em>buyers</em> are <em>exactly on a level</em> with
men-<em>stealers</em>.’ And again&mdash;‘Much less is it possible
that any child of man should ever be <em>born a slave</em>.’
Hear also Jonathan Edwards&mdash;‘To hold a man in a
state of slavery, is to be <em>every day guilty</em> of robbing
him of his liberty, or of <em>man-stealing</em>.’ And Grotius
says&mdash;‘Those are men-stealers who abduct, <em>keep</em>,
sell or buy <em>slaves</em> or freemen.’</p>

<p>If thou meanest merely that <em>acts</em> of that <em>same nature</em>,
but differently located in a series, are designated by
different terms, thus pointing out their different <em>relative
positions</em>, then thy argument concedes what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
affirm,&mdash;the identity in the <em>nature</em> of the acts, and
thus it dwindles to a mere philological criticism, or
rather a mere play upon words.</p>

<p>These are Abolition sentiments on the subject of
slaveholding; and although our principles are universally
held by our opposers at the North, yet I am told
on the 44th page of thy book, that ‘the word man-stealer
has one peculiar signification, and is no more
synonymous with slaveholder than it is with sheep-stealer.’
I must acknowledge, thou hast only confirmed
my opinion of the difference which I had believed
to exist between Abolitionists and their opponents.
As well might Saul have declared, that he held similar
views with Stephen, when he stood by and kept
the raiment of those who slew him.</p>

<p>I know that a broad line of distinction is drawn between
our principles and our measures, by those who
are anxious to ‘avoid the appearance of evil’&mdash;very
desirous of retaining the fair character of enemies to
slavery. Now, our <em>measures</em> are simply the carrying
out of our <em>principles</em>; and we find, that just in proportion
as individuals embrace our principles, in spirit
and in truth, they cease to cavil at our measures. Gerrit
Smith is a striking illustration of this. Who cavilled
more at Anti-Slavery <em>measures</em>, and who more
ready now to acknowledge his former blindness? Real
Abolitionists know full well, that the slave never
has been, and never can be, a whit the better for mere
abstractions, floating in the <em>head</em> of any man; and
they also know, that <em>principles, fixed in the heart</em>, are
things of another sort. The former have never done
any good in the world, because they possess no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
vitality, and therefore cannot bring forth <em>the fruits</em> of
holy, untiring effort; but the latter live in the lives of
their possessors, and breathe in their words. And I
am free to express my belief, that <em>all</em> who really and
heartily approve our <em>principles</em>, will also approve our
<em>measures</em>; and that, too, just as certainly as a good
tree will bring forth good fruit.</p>

<p>But there is another peculiarity in the views of Abolitionists.
We hold that the North is guilty of the
crime of slaveholding&mdash;we assert that it is a <em>national</em>
sin: on the contrary, in thy book, I find the following
acknowledgement:&mdash;‘<em>Most</em> persons in the non-slaveholding
States, have considered the matter of southern
slavery as one in which they were no more called
to interfere, than in the abolition of the press-gang
system in England, or the tithe-system in Ireland.’
Now I cannot see how the same principles can produce
such entirely different opinions. ‘Can a good
tree bring forth corrupt fruit?’ This I deny, and cannot
admit what thou art anxious to prove, viz. that
‘Public opinion may have been <em>wrong</em> on this point,
and yet <em>right</em> on all those great <em>principles</em> of rectitude
and justice relating to slavery.’ If Abolition principles
are generally adopted at the North, how comes it
to pass, that there is no abolition action here, except
what is put forth by a few despised fanatics, as they
are called? Is there any living faith without works?
Can the sap circulate vigorously, and yet neither blossoms
put forth nor fruit appear?</p>

<p>Again, I am told on the 7th page, that all Northern
Christians believe it is a sin to hold a man in slavery
for ‘<em>mere purposes of gain</em>;’ as if this was the <em>whole</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
abolition principle on this subject. I can assure thee
that Abolitionists do not stop here. Our principle is,
that <em>no circumstances can ever justify</em> a man in holding
his fellow man as <em>property</em>; it matters not what
<em>motive</em> he may give for such a monstrous violation of
the laws of God. The claim to him as <em>property</em> is an
annihilation of his right to himself, which is the foundation
upon which all his other rights are built. It is
high-handed robbery of Jehovah; for He has declared,
‘All souls are <em>mine</em>.’ For myself, I believe there
are hundreds of thousands at the South, who do <em>not</em>
hold their slaves, by any means, as much ‘for purposes
of gain,’ as they do from <em>the lust of power</em>: this is
the passion that reigns triumphant there, and those
who do not know this, have much yet to learn. Where,
then, is the similarity in our views?</p>

<p>I forbear for the present, and subscribe myself,</p>

<p>Thine, but not in the bonds of gospel Abolitionism,</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_II">LETTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Brookline</span>, Mass., <i>6th month, 17th, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: Where didst thou get thy statement
of what Abolitionists mean by immediate emancipation?
I assure thee, it is a novelty. I never heard
any abolitionist say that slaveholders ‘were physically
unable to emancipate their slaves, and of course are
not bound to do it,’ because in some States there are
laws which forbid emancipation. This is truly what
our opponents affirm; but <em>we</em> say that all the laws
which sustain the system of slavery are unjust and
oppressive&mdash;contrary to the fundamental principles of
morality, and, therefore, null and void.</p>

<p>We hold, that all the slaveholding laws violate the
fundamental principles of the Constitution of the
United States. In the preamble of that instrument,
the great objects for which it was framed are declared
to be ‘to establish justice, to promote the <em>general</em>
welfare, and to secure the blessings of <em>liberty</em> to us
and to our posterity.’ The slave laws are flagrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
violations of these fundamental principles. Slavery
subverts justice, promotes the welfare of the <em>few</em> to
the manifest injury of the many, and robs thousands
of the <em>posterity</em> of our forefathers of the blessings of
liberty. This cannot be denied, for Paxton, a Virginia
slaveholder, says, ‘the <em>best</em> blood in Virginia flows in
the veins of slaves!’ Yes, even the blood of a Jefferson.
And every southerner knows, that it is a common
thing for the <em>posterity of our forefathers</em> to be
sold on the vendue tables of the South. <em>The posterity
of our fathers</em> are advertised in American papers as
runaway slaves. Such advertisements often contain
expressions like these: ‘has sometimes passed himself
off as a <em>white</em> man,’&mdash;‘has been mistaken for a <em>white</em>
man,’&mdash;‘<em>quite white</em>, has <em>straight</em> hair, and would not
readily be taken for a slave,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now, thou wilt perceive, that, so far from thinking
that a slaveholder is bound by the <em>immoral</em> and <em>unconstitutional</em>
laws of the Southern States, <em>we</em> hold
that he is solemnly bound as a man, as an American,
to <em>break</em> them, and that <em>immediately</em> and openly; as
much so, as Daniel was to pray, or Peter and John to
preach&mdash;or every conscientious Quaker to refuse
to pay a militia fine, or to train, or to fight. <em>We</em>
promulgate no such time-serving doctrine as that set
forth by thee. When <em>we</em> talk of immediate emancipation,
we speak that we do mean, and the slaveholders
understand us, if thou dost not.</p>

<p>Here, then, is another point in which we are entirely
at variance, though the <em>principles</em> of abolitionism are
‘generally adopted by our opposers.’ What shall I
say to these things, but that I am glad thou hast afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
me an opportunity of explaining to thee what
<em>our principles</em> really are? for I apprehend that <em>thou</em>
‘hast not been sufficiently informed in regard to the
feelings and opinions’ of abolitionists.</p>

<p>It matters not to me what meaning ‘Dictionaries or
standard writers’ may give to immediate emancipation.
My Dictionary is the Bible; my standard authors,
prophets and apostles. When Jehovah commanded
Pharaoh to ‘let the people go,’ he meant that
they should be <em>immediately emancipated</em>. I read his
meaning in the judgments which terribly rebuked
Pharaoh’s repeated and obstinate refusal to ‘let the
people go.’ I read it in the <em>universal</em> emancipation of
near 3,000,000 of Israelites in <em>one awful night</em>.
When the prophet Isaiah commanded the Jews ‘to
loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,
and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break
every yoke,’ he taught no gradual or partial emancipation,
but <em>immediate, universal emancipation</em>. When
Jeremiah said, ‘Execute judgment in the <span class="smcapuc">MORNING</span>,
and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the
oppressor,’ he commanded <em>immediate</em> deliverance.
And so also with Paul, when he exhorted masters to
render unto their servants that which is just and equal.
Obedience to this command would <em>immediately</em> overturn
the whole system of American Slavery; for liberty
is justly <em>due</em> to every American citizen, according
to the laws of God and the Constitution of our country;
and a fair recompense for his labor is the right of
every man. Slaveholders know this is just as well as
we do. John C. Calhoun said in Congress, in 1833&mdash;‘He
who <em>earns</em> the money&mdash;who <em>digs it out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
earth</em> with the sweat of his brow, has a <em>just title</em> to it
against the Universe. <em>No one</em> has a right to touch it
<em>without his consent</em>, except his government, and <em>it
only</em> to the extent of its <em>legitimate</em> wants: to take more
is <em>robbery</em>.’</p>

<p>If our fundamental principle is right, that no man
can rightfully hold his fellow man as <em>property</em>, then it
follows, of course, that he is bound <em>immediately</em> to
cease holding him as such, and that, too, in <em>violation of
the immoral and unconstitutional laws</em> which have
been framed for the express purpose of ‘turning aside
the needy from judgment, and to take away the right
from the poor of the people, that widows may be their
prey, and that they may rob the fatherless.’ Every
slaveholder is bound to cease to do evil <em>now</em>, to emancipate
his slaves <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Dost thou ask what I mean by emancipation? I will
explain myself in a few words. 1. It is ‘to reject with
indignation, the wild and guilty phantasy, that man
can hold <em>property</em> in man.’ 2. To pay the laborer
his hire, for he is worthy of it. 3. No longer to deny
him the right of marriage, but to ‘let every man
have his own wife, and let every woman have her
own husband,’ as saith the apostle. 4. To let parents
have their own children, for they are the gift of the
Lord to <em>them</em>, and no one else has any right to them.
5. No longer to withhold the advantages of education
and the privilege of reading the Bible. 6. To put
the slave under the protection of equitable laws.</p>

<p>Now, why should not <em>all</em> this be done immediately?
Which of these things is to be done next year, and
which the year after? and so on. <em>Our</em> immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
emancipation means, doing justice and loving mercy
<em>to-day</em>&mdash;and this is what we call upon every slaveholder
to do.</p>

<p>I have seen too much of slavery to be a gradualist.
I dare not, in view of such a system, tell the slaveholder,
that ‘he is physically unable to emancipate his
slaves.’ I say <em>he is able</em> to let the oppressed go free,
and that such heaven-daring atrocities ought to <em>cease
now</em>, henceforth and forever. Oh, my very soul is
grieved to find a northern woman thus ‘sewing pillows
under all arm-holes,’ framing and fitting soft excuses
for the slaveholder’s conscience, whilst with the
same pen she is <em>professing</em> to regard slavery as a sin.
‘An open enemy is better than such a secret friend.’</p>

<p>Hoping that thou mayest soon be emancipated from
such inconsistency, I remain until then,</p>

<p>Thine <em>out</em> of the bonds of Christian Abolitionism,</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_III">LETTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">MAIN PRINCIPLE OF ACTION.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Lynn</span>, <i>6th Month, 23d, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:&mdash;I now pass on to the consideration of
‘the main principle of action in the Anti-Slavery Society.’
Thou art pleased to assert that it ‘rests wholly on
a false deduction from past experience.’ In this, also,
thou ‘hast not been sufficiently informed.’ Our main
principle of action is embodied in God’s holy command&mdash;‘Wash
you, make you clean, put away the evil of your
doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do
well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the
fatherless, plead for the widow.’ Under a solemn
conviction that it is our duty as Americans to ‘cry
aloud and spare not, to lift up our voices as a trumpet,
and to show our people their transgressions, and the
house of Jacob their sins,’ we are striving to rouse a
slumbering nation to a sense of the retributions which
must soon descend upon her guilty head, unless like
Ninevah she repent, and ‘break off her sins by righteousness,
and her transgressions by showing mercy to
the poor.’ <em>This</em> is our ‘main principle of action.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Does it rest ‘wholly on a false deduction from past
experience?’ or on the experience of Israel’s King,
who exclaimed, ‘In keeping of them (thy commandments,)
there is great reward.’</p>

<p>Thou art altogether under a mistake, if thou supposest
that our ‘main principle of action’ is the successful
effort of abolitionists in England, in reference
to the abolition of the slave-trade; for I hesitate not
to pronounce the attempts of Clarkson and Wilberforce,
at that period of their history, to have been a
<em>complete failure</em>; and never have the labors of any
philanthropists so fully showed the inefficacy of halfway
principles, as have those of these men of honorable
fame. The doctrines now advocated by the
American Anti-Slavery Society, were not advanced
by the abolitionists of that day. <em>They</em> were <em>not</em> immediate
abolitionists, but just such gradualists as thou
art even now. If I supposed that our labors in the
cause of the slave would produce <em>no better</em> results
than those of these worthies, I should utterly despair.
I need not remind thee, that they bent all their energies
to the annihilation of the slave-trade, under the
impression that <em>this</em> was the mother of slavery; and
that after toiling for twenty years, and obtaining the
passage of an act to that effect, the result was a mere
<em>nominal</em> abolition; for the atrocities of the slave-trade
are, if possible, <em>greater</em> now than ever. I will explain
what I mean. A friend of mine one evening last
winter, heard a conversation between two men, one of
whom had, until recently, been a slave-trader. He
had made several voyages to the coast of Africa, and
said that once his vessel was chased by an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
man of war, and that, in order to avoid a search and
the penalty of death, he threw every slave overboard;
and when his companion expressed surprise and horror
at such a wholesale murder, ‘Why,’ said the trader,
‘it was the fault of the English; they had no business
to make a law to hang a man on the yard arm,
if they caught him with slaves in his ship.’ He
intimated that it was not an uncommon thing for the
captains of slavers thus to save their lives.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Where,
then, I ask, is this glorious success of which we <em>hear</em>
so much, but <em>see</em> so little?</p>

<p>Let us travel onward, from the year 1806, when
England passed her abolition act. What were British
philanthropists doing for the emancipation of the
slave, for the next twenty years? Nothing at all; and
it was the voice of Elizabeth Heyrick which first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
awakened them from their dream of <em>gradualism</em> to
an understanding of the simple doctrine of immediate
emancipation; but even though they saw the injustice
and inefficiency of <em>their own</em> views, yet several
years elapsed before they had the courage to promulgate
hers. And now I can point thee to the success
of these efforts in the emancipation bill of 1834.
But even this success was paltry, in comparison with
what it would have been, had all the conspicuous
abolitionists of England been true to these just and
holy principles. Some of them were false to those
principles, and hence the compensation and apprenticeship
system. A few months ago, it was my privilege
to converse with Joseph Sturge, on his return
from the West Indies, via New York, to Liverpool,
whither he had gone to examine the working of England’s
plan of emancipation. I heard him speak of
the bounty of £20,000,000 which she had put into the
hands of the planters, of their mean and cruel abuse
of the apprenticeship system, and of the hearty approbation
he felt in the thorough-going principles of
the Anti-Slavery Societies in this country, and his
increased conviction that <em>ours</em> were the <em>only right</em>
principles on this important subject. That even the
apprenticeship system is viewed by British philanthropists
as a complete failure, is evident from the
fact that they are now re-organizing their Anti-Slavery
Societies, and circulating petitions for the substitution
of immediate emancipation in its stead.</p>

<p>Hence it appears, that so far from our resting
‘wholly upon <em>a false deduction from past experience</em>,’
we are resting on <em>no</em> experience at all; for no class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
men in the world ever have maintained the principles
which we now advocate. Our main principle of
action is ‘obedience to God’&mdash;our hope of success is
faith in Him, and that faith is as unwavering as He
is true and powerful. ‘Blessed is the man who
trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.’</p>

<p>With regard to the connection between the North
and the South, I shall say but little, having already
sent thee my views on that subject in the letter to
‘Clarkson,’ originally published in the New Haven
Religious Intelligencer. I there pointed out fifteen
different ways in which the North was implicated in
the guilt of slavery; and, therefore, I deny the charge
that abolitionists are endeavoring ‘to convince their
fellow citizens of the faults of <em>another</em> community.’
Not at all. We are spreading out the horrors of slavery
before Northerners, in order to show them <em>their own
sin</em> in sustaining such a system of complicated wrong
and suffering. It is because we are politically, commercially,
and socially connected with our southern
brethren, that we urge our doctrines upon those of the
free States. We have begun our work <em>here</em>, because
pro-slavery men of the North are to the system of
slavery just what temperate drinkers were to the vice
of intemperance. Temperance reformers did not <em>begin</em>
their labors among drunkards, but among temperate
drinkers: so Anti-Slavery reformers did not <em>begin</em>
their labors among slaveholders, but among those who
were making their fortunes out of the unrequited toil
of the slave, and receiving large mortgages on southern
plantations and slaves, and trading occasionally
in ‘slaves and the souls of men,’ and sending men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Congress to buy up southern land to be converted
into slave States, such as Louisiana and Florida, which
cost <em>this nation</em> $20,000,000&mdash;men who have admitted
seven slave States into the Union&mdash;men who boast
on the floor of Congress, that ‘there is no cause in
which they would sooner buckle a knapsack on their
backs and shoulder a musket, than that of putting
down a servile insurrection at the South,’ as said the
present Governor of Massachusetts, which odious sentiment
was repeated by Governor Lincoln only last
winter&mdash;men who, trained up on Freedom’s soil, yet
go down to the South and marry slaveholders, and
become slaveholders, and then return to our northern
cities with slaves in their train. This is the case
with a native of this town, who is now here with his
southern wife and southern <em>slave</em>. And as soon as
we reform the recreant sons and daughters of the
North,&mdash;as soon as we rectify public opinion at the
North,&mdash;then I, for one, will promise to go down into
the midst of slaveholders themselves, to promulgate
our doctrines in the land of the slave. But how can
we go now, when northern pulpits and meeting-houses
are closed, and northern ministers are dumb, and
northern Governors are declaring that ‘the discussion
of the subject of slavery ought to be made an offence
indictable at common law,’ and northern women are
writing books to paralyze the efforts of southern women,
who have come up from the South, to entreat
their northern sisters to exert their influence in behalf
of the slave, and in behalf of the slaveholder, who is
as deeply corrupted, though not equally degraded, with
the slave. No! No! the taunts of a New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
woman will induce no abolitionist to cease his rebuke
of <em>northern slaveholders</em> and apologists for slavery.
Southerners see the wisdom of <em>this</em>, if <em>thou</em> canst not;
and over against thy opinion, I will place that of a
Louisiana planter, who, whilst on a visit to his relatives
at Uxbridge, Mass. this summer, unhesitatingly admitted
that the <em>North was the right place to begin
Anti-Slavery efforts</em>. Had I not been convinced of
this before, surely thy book would have been all-sufficient
to satisfy me of it; for a more subtle defence of
the slaveholder’s right to property in his helpless victims,
I never saw. It is just such a defence as the
hidden enemies of Liberty will rejoice to see, because,
like thyself, they earnestly desire to ‘avoid the <em>appearance
of evil</em>;’ they are as much opposed to slavery as
we are, only they are as much opposed to Anti-Slavery
as the slaveholders themselves. Is there any
middle path in this reformation? Or may we not
fairly conclude, that he or <em>she</em> that is not for the slave,
in deed and in truth, is <em>against</em> him, no matter how
specious their professions of pity for his condition?</p>

<span class="smaller">CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Danvers</span>, Mass., <i>7th mo., 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:&mdash;I thank thee for having furnished
me with just such a simile as I needed to illustrate the
connection which exists between the North and the
South. Thou sayest, ‘Suppose two rival cities, one of
which becomes convinced that certain practices in trade
and business in the other are dishonest, and have an oppressive
bearing on certain classes in that city. Suppose,
also, that these are practices, which, by those who allow
them, are considered as honorable and right. Those
who are convinced of this immorality wish to alter
the opinions and the practices of the citizens of their
rival city, and to do this they commence the collection
of facts, that exhibit the tendencies of these practices
and the evils they have engendered. But, instead of
going among the community in which the evil exists,
and endeavoring to convince them, they proceed to
form voluntary associations among their neighbors at
home, and spend their time, money, and efforts to
convince their fellow citizens that the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
their rival city are guilty of a great sin.’ Now I will
take up the comparison here, and suppose a few other
things about these two cities. Suppose that the people
in one city were <em>known never</em> to pay the laborer
his wages, but to be in the constant habit of keeping
back the hire of those who reaped down their fields;
and that, on examination, it was found that the people
in the other city were continually going over to live
with these gentlemen oppressors, and instead of rebuking
them, were joining hands in wickedness with
them, and were actually <em>more</em> oppressive to the poor
than the native inhabitants. Suppose, too, it was
found that many of the merchants in the city of Fairdealing,
as it was called, were known to hold mortgages,
not only upon the property which ought to
belong to the unpaid laborers, but mortgages, too, on
the <em>laborers themselves</em>, ay, and <em>their wives and children
also</em>, a thing altogether contrary to the laws of
their city, and the customs of their people, and the
principles of fundamental morality. Suppose, too, it
was found that the people in the city of Oppression
were in the constant practice of sending over to the
city of Fairdealing, and bribing their citizens to seize
the poorest, most defenceless of their people for them,
because they were so lazy they would not do their
own work, and so mean they would not pay others
for doing it, and chose thus to supply themselves with
laborers, who, when they once got into the city, were
placed under such severe laws, that it was almost impossible
for them ever to return to their afflicted wives
and children. Suppose, too, that whenever any of
these oppressed, unpaid laborers happened to escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from the city of Oppression, and after lying out in the
woods and fastnesses which lay between the two cities,
for many weeks, ‘in weariness and painfulness, in
watchings, in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness,’
that, as soon as they reached the city of Fairdealing,
they were most unmercifully hunted out and
sent back to their cruel oppressors, who it was well
known generally treated such laborers with great cruelty,
‘<em>stern necessity</em>’ demanding that they should be
punished and ‘rebuked before all, that others might
fear’ the consequences of such elopement. In short,
suppose that the city of Fairdealing was so completely
connected with the city of Oppression, that the golden
strands of their interests were twisted together so as
to form a bond of Union stronger than death, and that
by the intermarriages which were constantly taking
place, there was also a silken cord of love tying up
and binding together the tender feelings of their hearts
with all the intricacies of the Gordian knot; and then,
again, that the identity of the political interests of these
cities were wound round and round them like bands
of iron and brass, altogether forming an union so
complicated and powerful, that it was impossible even
to <em>speak</em> in the most solemn manner, in the city of
Fairdealing, of the enormous crimes which were
common in the city of Oppression, without having
brickbats and rotten eggs hurled at the speaker’s
head. Suppose, too, that although it was perfectly
manifest to every reflecting mind, that a most guilty
copartnership existed between these two cities, yet
that the ‘gentlemen of property and standing’ of the
city of Fairdealing were continually taunting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
people who were trying to represent <em>their</em> iniquitous
league with the city of Oppression in its true and
sinful bearings, with the query of ‘Why don’t you
go to the city of Oppression, and tell the people there,
not to rob the poor?’ Might not these reformers
very justly remark, we cannot go there <em>until</em> we have
persuaded <em>our own</em> citizens to cease <em>their unholy co-operation
with them</em>, for they will certainly turn upon
us in bitter irony and say&mdash;‘Physician, heal thyself;’
go back to your own city, and tell your own citizens
‘to break off <em>their</em> sins by righteousness, and <em>their</em>
transgressions by showing mercy to the poor,’ who
fly from our city into the gates of theirs for protection,
but receive it not. Would not common sense bear
them out in refusing to go there, until they had <em>first</em>
converted <em>their own</em> people from the error of their
ways? I will leave thee and my other readers to
make the application of this comparison; and if thou
dost not acknowledge that abolitionists have been
governed by the soundest common sense in the course
they have pursued at the North with regard to slavery,
then I am very much disappointed in thy professions
of <em>candor</em>. With regard to the parallel thou
hast drawn (p. 16,) between abolitionists, and the
‘men (who) are daily going into the streets, and calling
all bystanders around them’ and pointing out certain
men, some as liars, some as dishonest, some as licentious,
and then bringing proofs of their guilt and rebuking
them before all; at the same time exhorting
all around to point at them the finger of scorn; thou
sayest, ‘they persevere in this course till the whole
community is thrown into an uproar; and assaults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and even bloodshed ensue.’ But why, I should like
to know, if these people are themselves <em>guiltless</em> of
the crimes alleged against the others? I cannot understand
why they should be so angry, unless, like
the Jews of old, they perceived that the parable had
been spoken ‘<em>against them</em>.’ To my own mind, the
exasperation of the North at the discussion of slavery
is an undeniable proof of <em>her guilt</em>, a certain evidence
of the necessity of her plucking the beam out of her
own eye, <em>before</em> she goes to the South to rebuke sin
there. To thee, and to all who are continually
crying out, ‘Why don’t you go to the South?’ I retort
the question by asking, why don’t <span class="smcapuc">YOU</span> go to the
South? <em>We</em> conscientiously believe that this work
must be commenced <em>here</em> at the North; this is an
all-sufficient answer for <span class="smcapuc">US</span>; but <span class="smcapuc">YOU</span>, who are ‘as
much anti-slavery as we are,’ and differ <em>only</em> as to
the modus operandi, believing that the South and <em>not</em>
the North ought to be the field of Anti-Slavery labors&mdash;<span class="smcapuc">YOU</span>,
I say, have no excuse to offer, and are bound
to go there now.</p>

<p>But there is another view to be taken of this subject.
By all our printing and talking at the North,
we <em>have actually reached the very heart of the disease
at the South</em>. They acknowledge it themselves.
Read the following confession in the Southern Literary
Review. ‘There are <em>many good men even
among us, who have begun to grow timid</em>. They
think that what the virtuous and high-minded men
of the North look upon as a crime and a plague-spot,
<em>cannot</em> be perfectly innocent or quite harmless in a
slaveholding community.’ James Smylie, of Mississippi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a minister of the gospel, <em>so called</em>, tells us on
the very first page of his essay, written to uphold the
doctrines of Governor McDuffie, ‘that the abolition
maxim, viz. that slavery is <em>in itself sinful</em>, had gained
on and entwined itself among the <em>religious</em> and <em>conscientious</em>
scruples of <em>many</em> in the community, so far
as to render them <em>unhappy</em>.’ I could quote other
southern testimony to the same effect, but will pass
on to another fact just published in the New England
Spectator; a proposition from a minister in Missouri
‘to have separate organizations for slavery and anti-slavery
professors,’ and indeed ‘all over the <em>slaveholding
States</em>.’ Has our labor then been in vain
in the Lord? Have we failed to rouse the slumbering
consciences of the South?</p>

<p>Thou inquirest&mdash;‘Have the northern States power
to rectify evils at the South, as they have to remove
their own moral deformities?’ I answer unhesitatingly,
certainly they have, for <em>moral</em> evils can be removed
only by <em>moral</em> power; and the close connection
which exists between these two portions of our
country, affords the greatest possible facilities for exerting
a <em>moral</em> influence on it. Only let the North
exert as much moral influence over the South, as the
South has exerted demoralizing influence over the
North, and slavery would die amid the flame of
Christian remonstrance, and faithful rebuke, and holy
indignation. The South has told us so. In the report
of the committee on federal relations in the Legislature
of South Carolina last winter, we find the
following acknowledgement: ‘Let it be admitted,
that by reason of an efficient police and judicious internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
legislation, we may render abortive the designs
of the fanatic and incendiary within our limits, and
that the torrent of pamphlets and tracts which the
abolition presses of the North are pouring forth with
an inexhaustible copiousness, is arrested the moment
it reaches our frontier. Are we to wait until our
enemies have built up, by the grossest misrepresentations
and falsehoods, a <em>body of public opinion, which
it would be impossible to resist</em>, without separating
ourselves from the social system of the rest of the
civilized world?’ Here is the acknowledgement of a
southern legislature, that it will be <em>impossible for the
South to resist the influence</em> of that body of <em>public
opinion</em>, which abolitionists are building up against
them at the North. If further evidence is needed,
that anti-slavery societies are producing a powerful
influence at the South, look at the efforts made there
to vilify and crush them. Why all this turmoil, and
passion, and rage in the slaveholder, if we have indeed
rolled back the cause of emancipation 200 years, as
thy father has asserted? Why all this terror at the
distant roar of free discussion, if they feel not the
earth quaking beneath them? Does not the <em>South</em>
understand what really will affect her interests and
break down her domestic institution? Has <em>she</em> no
subtle politicians, no far-sighted men in her borders,
who can scan the practical bearings of these troublous
times? Believe me, she has; and did they not know
that we are springing a mine beneath the great bastile
of slavery, and laying a train which will soon whelm
it in ruin, she would not be quite so eager ‘to cut out
our tongues, and hang us as high as Haman.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>I will just add, that as to the committee saying
that abolitionists are building up a body of public
opinion at the North ‘by the grossest misrepresentations
and falsehoods,’ I think it was due to <em>their</em>
character for veracity, to have cited and refuted some
of these calumnies. Until they do, we must believe
them; and as a Southerner, I can bear the most decided
testimony against slavery as the mother of <em>all</em>
abominations.</p>

<span class="smaller">CHRISTIAN CHARACTER OF ABOLITIONISM.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Newburyport</span>, <i>7th mo. 8th, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: As an Abolitionist, I thank thee for
the portrait thou hast drawn of the character of those
with whom I am associated. They deserve all thou
hast said in their favor; and I will now endeavor to
vindicate those ‘men of pure morals, of great honesty
of purpose, of real benevolence and piety,’ from some
objections thou hast urged against their measures.</p>

<p>‘Much evidence,’ thou sayest, ‘can be brought to
prove that the character and measures of the Abolition
Society are not either peaceful or christian in
tendency, but that they are in their nature calculated
to generate party spirit, denunciation, recrimination,
and angry passion.’ Now I solemnly ask thee, whether
the character and measures of our holy Redeemer
did not produce exactly the same effects? Why did
the Jews lead him to the brow of the hill, that they
might cast him down headlong; why did they go about
to kill him; why did they seek to lay hands on him,
if the tendency of <em>his</em> measures was so very <em>pacific</em>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Listen, too, to his own declaration: ‘I came not to send
peace on earth, but a sword;’ the effects of which, he
expressly said, would be to set the mother against her
daughter, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
The rebukes which he uttered against sin
were eminently calculated to produce ‘recriminations
and angry passions,’ in all who were determined to
<em>cleave</em> to their sins; and they did produce them even
against ‘him who did no sin, neither was guile found
in his mouth.’ He was called a wine-bibber, and a
glutton, and Beelzebub, and was accused of casting out
devils by the prince of the devils. Why, then, protest
against our measures as <em>unchristian</em>, because they
do not smooth the pillow of the poor sinner, and lull
his conscience into fatal security? The truth is, the
efforts of abolitionists have stirred up the <em>very same
spirit</em> which the efforts of <em>all thorough-going</em> reformers
have ever done; we consider it a certain proof
that the truths we utter are sharper than any two
edged sword, and that they are doing the work of conviction
in the hearts of our enemies. If it be not so,
I have greatly mistaken the character of Christianity.
I consider it pre-eminently aggressive; it waits not to
be assaulted, but moves on in all the majesty of Truth
to <em>attack</em> the strong holds of the kingdom of darkness,
carries the war into the enemy’s camp, and throws its
fiery darts into the midst of its embattled hosts. Thou
seemest to think, on the contrary, that Christianity is
just such a weak, dependent, puerile creature as thou
hast described woman to be. In my opinion, thou
hast robbed both the one and the other of all their
true dignity and glory. Thy descriptions may suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the prevailing christianity of this age, and the general
character of woman; and if so, we have great cause
for shame and confusion of face.</p>

<p>I feel sorry that thy unkind insinuations against the
christian character of Wm. Lloyd Garrison, have rendered
it necessary for me to speak of him individually,
because what I shall feel bound to say of him may,
to some like thyself, appear like flattery; but I must
do what justice seems so clearly to call for at my
hands. Thou sayest that ‘though he professes a belief
in the christian religion, he is an avowed opponent
of most of its institutions.’ I presume thou art
here alluding to his views of the ordinances of baptism
and the Lord’s supper, and the Sabbath. Permit
me to remind thee, that in <em>all</em> these opinions, he coincides
entirely with the Society of Friends, whose
views of the Sabbath never were so ably vindicated
as by his pen: and the insinuations of hypocrisy
which thou hast thrown out against him, may with
just as much truth be cast upon <em>them</em>. The Quakers
think that these are not <em>christian</em> institutions, but thou
hast assumed it without any proof at all. Thou sayest
farther, ‘The character and spirit of <em>this man</em> have
for years been exhibited in the Liberator.’ I have
taken that paper for two years, and therefore understand
its character, and am compelled to acknowledge,
that harsh and severe as is the language often used, I
have never seen any expressions which <em>truth</em> did not
warrant. The abominations of slavery <em>cannot</em> be
otherwise described. I think Dr. Channing exactly
portrayed the character of brother Garrison’s writings
when he said, ‘That deep feeling of evils, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<em>necessary</em> to <em>effectual</em> conflict with them, which marks
<em>God’s most powerful messengers to mankind, cannot</em>
breathe itself in soft and tender accents. The deeply
moved soul <em>will</em> speak strongly, and <em>ought</em> to speak
strongly, so as to move and shake nations.’ It is well for
the slave, and well for this country, that such a man was
sent to sound the tocsin of alarm before slavery had completed
its work of moral death in this ‘hypocritical nation.’
Garrison began that discussion of the subject of
slavery, which J. Q. Adams declared in his oration, delivered
in this town on the 4th inst. ‘to be the only safety-valve
by which the high pressure boiler of slavery
could be prevented from a most fatal explosion in this
country;’ and as a Southerner, I feel truly grateful for
all his efforts to redeem not the slave only, but the
<em>slaveholder</em>, from the polluting influences of such a
system of crime.</p>

<p>In his character as a man and a Christian, I have
the highest confidence. The assertion thou makest,
‘that there is to be found in that paper, or <em>any thing
else, any</em> evidence of his possessing the peculiar traits
of Wilberforce, (benignity, gentleness and kind heartedness,
I suppose thou meanest,) not even his warmest
admirers will maintain,’ is altogether new to me;
and I for one feel ready to declare, that I have never
met in any one a more lovely exhibition of these traits
of character. I might relate several anecdotes in
proof of this assertion, but let one suffice. A friend
of mine, a member of the Society of Friends, told me
that after he became interested in the Anti-Slavery
cause through the Liberator, he still felt so much prejudice
against its editor, that, although he wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
labor in behalf of the slaves, he still felt as if he
could not identify himself with a society which recognized
such a leader as he had heard Wm. L. Garrison
was. He had never seen him, and after many
struggles of feeling, determined to go to Boston on
purpose to see ‘this man,’ and judge of his character
for himself. He did so, and when he entered the office
of the Liberator, soon fell into conversation with
a person he did not know, and became very much interested
in him. After some time, a third person
came in and called off the attention of the stranger,
whose benevolent countenance and benignant manners
he had so much admired. He soon heard him addressed
as Mr. Garrison, which astonished him very
much; for he had expected to see some coarse, uncouth
and rugged creature, instead of the perfect gentleman
he now learned was Wm. L. Garrison. He
told me that the effect upon his mind was so great,
that he sat down and wept to think he had allowed
himself to be so prejudiced against a person, who was
so entirely different from what his enemies had represented
him to be. He at once felt as if he could most
cheerfully labor, heart and hand, with such a man,
and has for the last three or four years been a faithful
co-worker with him, in the holy cause of immediate
emancipation. And his confidence in him as a man
of pure, <em>christian</em> principle, has grown stronger and
stronger, as time has advanced, and circumstances
have developed his true character. I think it is impossible
thou canst be personally acquainted with
brother Garrison, or thou wouldst not write of him in
the way thou hast. If thou really wishest to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
thy erroneous opinions removed, embrace the first opportunity
of being introduced to him; for I can assure
thee, that with the fire of a Paul, he does possess some
of the most lovely traits in the character of Wilberforce.</p>

<p>In much haste, I remain thy friend,</p>

<span class="smaller">COLONIZATION.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Amesbury</span>, <i>7th mo. 20th, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: The <em>aggressive</em> spirit of Anti-Slavery
papers and pamphlets, of which thou dost complain, so
far from being a repulsive one to me, is very attractive.
I see in it that uncompromising integrity and
fearless rebuke of sin, which will bear the enterprize
of emancipation through to its consummation. And I
most heartily desire to see these publications scattered
over our land as abundantly as the leaves of Autumn,
believing as I do that the principles they promulgate
will be as leaves for the healing of this nation.</p>

<p>I proceed to examine thy objections to ‘one of the
first measures of Abolitionists:’ their attack on a <em>benevolent</em>
society.</p>

<p>That the Colonization Society is a <em>benevolent</em> institution,
we deny: therefore our attack upon it was not
a sacrilegious one; it was absolutely necessary, in order
to disabuse the public mind of the false views they
entertained of its character. And it is a perfect mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to me how men and women can <em>conscientiously</em>
persevere in upholding a society, which the very objects
of its professed benevolence have repeatedly, solemnly,
constantly and universally condemned. To
say the least, this is a very suspicious kind of benevolence,
and seems too nearly allied to that, which induces
some southern professors to keep their brethren
in bonds <em>for their benefit</em>. Yes, the free colored people
are to be exiled, because public opinion is crushing
them into the dust; instead of their friends protesting
against that corrupt and unreasonable prejudice, and
living it down by a practical acknowledgement of their
<em>right</em> to <em>every</em> privilege, social, civil and religious,
which is enjoyed by the white man. I have never
yet been able to learn, how our hatred to our colored
brother is to be destroyed by driving him away from
us. I am told that when a colored republic is built
up on the coast of Africa, then we shall respect that
republic, and acknowledge that the character of the
colored man can be elevated; we will become connected
with it in a commercial point of view, and welcome
it to the sympathies of our hearts. Miserable
sophistry! deceitful apology for present indulgence in
sin! What man or woman of common sense now
doubts the intellectual capacity of the colored people?
Who does not know, that with all our efforts as a nation
to crush and ‘<em>annihilate the mind</em> of this portion
of our race,’ we have never yet been able to do it?
Henry Berry of Virginia, in his speech in the Legislature
of that State, in 1832, expressly acknowledged,
that although slaveholders had ‘as far as possible closed
every avenue by which light might enter their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
minds,’ yet that they never had found out the process
by which they ‘could extinguish the <em>capacity</em> to see
the light.’ No! that capacity remains&mdash;it is indestructible&mdash;an
integral part of their nature, as moral
and immortal beings.</p>

<p>If it is true that white Americans only need a demonstration
of the colored man’s capacity for elevation,
in order to make them willing to receive him on
the same platform of human rights upon which they
stand, why has not the intelligence of the Haytians
convinced them? <em>Their</em> free republic has grown up
under the very eye of the slaveholder, and as a nation
we have for many years been carrying on a lucrative
trade with her merchants; and yet we have never recognized
her independence, never sent a minister
there, though we have sent ambassadors to European
countries whose commerce is far less important to us
than that of St. Domingo.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>These professions of a wish to plant the tree of
Liberty on the shores of Africa, in order to convince
our Republican Despotism of the high moral and intellectual
worth of the colored man, are perfectly absurd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Hayti has done that long ago. A friend of
mine (not an Abolitionist) whose business called him
to that island for several months, told me that in the
society of its citizens, he often felt his own inferiority.
He was astonished at the elegance of their manners,
and the intelligence of their conversation. Instead of
going into an examination of Colonization principles,
I refer thee to the Appeal to the Women of the nominally
free States, issued by the Convention of American
Women, in which we set forth our reasons for
repudiating them.</p>

<p>Thou hast given a specimen of the manner in
which Abolitionists deal with their Colonization opponents.
Thy friend remarked, after an interview with
an abolitionist, ‘I love truth and sound argument; but
when a man comes at me with a sledge hammer, I
cannot help dodging.’ I presume thy friend only felt
the truth of the prophet’s declaration, ‘Is not my word
like as a fire, saith the Lord, and like a <em>hammer</em> that
breaketh the rock in pieces?’ I wonder not that he
did <em>dodge</em>, when the sledge hammer of truth was wielded
by an abolition army. Many a Colonizationist has
been compelled to dodge, in order to escape the blows of
this hammer of the Lord’s word, for there is no other way
to get clear. We must either <em>dodge</em> the arguments of abolitionists,
or like J. G. Birney, Edward C. Delevan,
and many others, be willing to be broken to pieces by
them. I greatly like this specimen of private dealing,
and hope it is not the only instance which has come
under thy notice, of Colonizationists acknowledging
the absolute necessity of <em>dodging</em> Anti-Slavery arguments,
when they were unwilling that the <em>rock of prejudice</em>
should be broken to pieces by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Thy next complaint is against the <em>manner</em> in which
this benevolent <span class="smcap">Expatriation</span> Society was attacked.
‘The style in which the thing was done was at once
offensive, inflammatory and exasperating,’&mdash;‘the feelings
of many sincere, upright, and conscientious men
were harrowed by a sense of the injustice, the indecorum
and the unchristian treatment they received.’
But why, if <em>they</em> were entirely innocent of the charges
brought against Colonizationists? I have been in the
habit, for several years past, of watching the workings
of my own mind under true and false charges against
myself; and my experience is, that the more clear I
am of the charge, the less I care about it. If I really
feel a sweet assurance that ‘my witness is in heaven&mdash;my
record is on high,’ I then realize to its fullest
extent that ‘it is a small thing to be judged of <em>man’s</em>
judgment,’ and I can bear <em>false</em> charges unmoved; but
true ones always nettle me, if I am unwilling to confess
that ‘I have sinned;’ if I am, and yield to conviction,
O then! how sweet the reward! Now I am
very much afraid that these sincere, upright and conscientious
Colonizationists are something like the <em>pious
professors</em> of the South, who are very angry because
abolitionists say that all slaveholders are men-stealers.
Both find it ‘hard to kick against the pricks’
of conviction, and both are unwilling to repent. A
northern man remarked to a Virginia slaveholder last
winter, ‘that as the South denied the charges brought
against her by abolitionists, he could not understand
why she was so enraged; for,’ continued he, ‘if you
were to accuse us at the North of being sheep-stealers,
we should not care about the charge&mdash;we should ridicule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it.’ ‘O!’ said the Virginian with an oath, ‘what
the abolitionists say about slaveholders is <em>too true</em>,
and <em>that’s the reason</em> we are vexed.’ Is not this the
reason why our Colonization brethren and sisters are
so angry? Is not what we say of them also <em>too true</em>?
Let them examine these things with the bible and
prayer, and settle this question between God and their
own souls.</p>

<p>Every true friend of the oppressed American has
great cause to rejoice, that the cloak of benevolence
has been torn off from the monster Prejudice, which
could love the colored man <em>after</em> he got to Africa, but
seemed to delight to pour contumely upon him whilst
he remained in the land of his birth. I confess it
would be very hard for me to believe that any association
of men and women loved me or my family, if, because
we had become obnoxious to them, they were to
meet together, and concentrate their energies and pour
out their money for the purpose of transporting us back
to France, whence our Huguenot fathers fled to this
country to escape the storm of persecutions. Why not
let us live in America, if you really <em>love</em> us? Surely
you never want to ‘<em>get rid</em>’ of people whom you <em>love</em>.
<em>I</em> like to have such near me; and it is because I love
the colored Americans, that I want them to stay in
this country; and in order to make it a happy home
to them, I am trying to talk down, and write down, and
live down this horrible prejudice. Sending a few to
Africa cannot destroy it. No&mdash;we must dig up the
weed by the roots out of each of our hearts. <em>It is a
sin</em>, and we must repent of it and forsake it&mdash;and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
we shall no longer be so anxious to ‘<em>be clear of them</em>,’
‘<em>to get rid of them</em>.’</p>

<p>Hoping, though against hope, that thou mayest one
day know how precious is the reward of those who
can love our oppressed brethren and sisters in this day
of their calamity, and who, despising the shame of being
identified with these peeled and scattered ones,
rejoice to stand side by side with them, in the glorious
conflict between Slavery and Freedom, Prejudice and
Love unfeigned, I remain thine in the bonds of universal
love,</p>

<span class="smaller">PREJUDICE.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Haverhill</span>, Mass., <i>7th mo. 23, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:&mdash;Thou sayest, ‘the <em>best</em> way to
make a person like a thing which is disagreeable, is
to try in some way to make it agreeable.’ So, then,
instead of convincing a person by sound argument
and pointed rebuke that sin is <em>sin</em>, we are to <em>disguise</em>
the opposite virtue in such a way as to make him like
that, in preference to the sin he had so dearly loved.
We are to <em>cheat</em> a sinner out of his sin, rather than
to compel him, under the stings of conviction, to give
it up from deep-rooted principle.</p>

<p>If this is the course pursued by ministers, then I
wonder not at the kind of converts which are brought
into the church at the present day. Thy remarks
on the subject of prejudice, show but too plainly how
strongly thy own mind is imbued with it, and how
little thy colonization principles have done to exterminate
this feeling from thy own bosom. Thou sayest,
‘if a certain class of persons is the subject of unreasonable
prejudice, the peaceful and christian way of
removing it would be to endeavor to render the unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
persons who compose this class, so useful,
so <em>humble, so unassuming</em>, &amp;c. that prejudice would
be supplanted by complacency in their goodness, and
<em>pity</em> and sympathy for their disabilities.’ ‘If the
friends of the blacks had quietly set themselves to
work to increase their intelligence, their usefulness,
&amp;c. and then had appealed to the <em>pity</em> and benevolence
of their fellow citizens, a very different result
would have appeared.’ Or in other words, if one
person is guilty of a sin against another person, I am
to let the sinner go entirely unreproved, but to persuade
the injured party to bear with humility and
patience all the outrages that are inflicted upon him,
and thus try to soothe the sinner ‘into complacency
with their goodness’ in ‘bearing all things, and enduring
all things.’ Well, suppose I succeed:&mdash;is
that sinner won from the evil of his ways by <em>principle</em>?
No! Has he the principle of love implanted
in his breast? No! Instead of being in love with
the virtue exhibited by the individual, because <em>it is
virtue</em>, he is delighted with the personal convenience
he experiences from the exercise of that virtue. He
feels kindly toward the individual, <em>because</em> he is an
<em>instrument</em> of his enjoyment, a mere <em>means</em> to promote
his wishes. There is <em>no</em> reformation there at all.
And so the colored people are to be taught to be ‘very
<em>humble</em>’ and ‘<em>unassuming</em>,’ ‘<em>gentle</em>’ and ‘<em>meek</em>,’ and
then the ‘<em>pity</em> and generosity’ of their fellow citizens are
to be appealed to. Now, no one who knows anything
of the influence of Abolitionists over the colored people,
can deny that it has been <em>peaceful</em> and christian;
had it not been so, they never would have seen those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
whom they had regarded as their best friends, mobbed
and persecuted, without raising an arm in their defence.
Look, too, at the rapid spread of thorough
temperance principles among them, and their moral
reform and other laudable and useful associations;
look at the rising character of this people, the new
life and energy which have been infused into them.
Who have done it? Who have exerted by far the
greatest influence on these oppressed Americans? I
leave thee to answer. I will give thee one instance
of this salutary influence. In a letter I received from
one of my colored sisters, she incidentally makes this
remark:&mdash;‘Until very lately, I have lived and acted
more for <em>myself</em> than for the good of others. I confess
that I am <em>wholly indebted to the Abolition cause</em>
for arousing me from apathy and indifference, and
shedding light into a mind which has been too long
wrapt in selfish darkness.’ The Abolition cause has
exerted a powerful and healthful influence over this
class of our population, and it has been done by
quietly going into the midst of them, and identifying
ourselves with them.</p>

<p>But Abolitionists are complained of, because they,
at the same time, fearlessly exposed the <em>sin</em> of the
unreasonable and unholy prejudice which existed
against these injured ones. Thou sayest ‘that reproaches,
rebukes and sneers were employed to convince
the whites that their prejudices were sinful, and
<em>without</em> any just cause.’ <em>Without any just cause!</em>
Couldst thou think so, if thou really loved thy colored
sisters <em>as thyself</em>? The unmeasured abuse which,
the Colonization Society was heaping upon this despised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
people, was no <em>just cause</em> for pointed rebuke, I
suppose! The manner in which they are thrust into
one corner of our meeting-houses, as if the plague-spot
was on their skins; the rudeness and cruelty
with which they are treated in our hotels, and steamboats,
rail road cars and stages, is <em>no just cause</em> of
reproach to a professed christian community, I presume.
Well, all that I can say is, that I believe if
Isaiah or James were now alive, they would pour
their reproaches and rebukes upon the heads and
<em>hearts</em> of those who are thus despising the Lord’s
poor, and saying to those whose spirits are clothed
by God in the ‘vile raiment’ of a <em>colored skin</em>, ‘Stand
thou there in yonder gallery, or sit thou here in ‘the
negro-pew.’ ‘Sneers,’ too, are complained of. Have
abolitionists ever made use of greater sarcasm and
irony than did the prophet Elijah? When things
are ridiculous as well as wicked, it is unreasonable
to expect that every cast of mind will treat them with
solemnity. And what is more ridiculous than American
prejudice; to proscribe and persecute men and
women, because their <em>complexions</em> are of a darker hue
than our own? Why, it is an outrage upon common
sense; and as my brother Thomas S. Grimké remarked
only a few weeks before his death, ‘posterity will
laugh at our prejudices.’ Where is the harm, then,
if abolitionists should laugh now at the wicked absurdity?</p>

<p>Thou sayest, ‘this tended to irritate the whites, and
to increase their prejudices against the blacks.’ The
<em>truth always</em> irritates the proud, impenitent sinner.
To charge abolitionists with this irritation, is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
like the charge brought against the English
government by the captain of the slaver I told thee of
in my second letter, who threw all his human merchandize
overboard, in order to escape detection, and
then charged this horrible wholesale murder upon the
government; because, said he, they had no business
to make a law to hang a man if he was found engaged
in the slave trade. So <em>we</em> must bear the guilt of
man’s angry passions, because the <em>truth</em> we preach is
like a two-edged sword, cutting through the bonds of
interest on the one side, and the cords of caste on the
other.</p>

<p>As to our increasing the prejudice against color,
this is just like the North telling us that we have increased
the miseries of the slave. Common sense
cries out against the one as well as the other. With
regard to prejudice, I believe the truth of the case to
be this: the rights of the colored man <em>never</em> were advocated
by any body of men in their length and
breadth, before the rise of the Anti-Slavery Society
in this country. The propagation of these ultra principles
has produced in the northern States exactly the
same effect, which the promulgation of the doctrine
of immediate emancipation has done in the southern
States. It has <em>developed</em> the latent principles of pride
and prejudice, not <em>produced</em> them. Hear John Green,
a Judge of the Circuit Court of Kentucky, in reference
to abolition efforts having given birth to the opposition
against emancipation now existing in the South: ‘I
would rather say, it has been the means of <em>manifesting</em>
that opposition, which <em>previously</em> existed, but <em>laid
dormant</em> for want of an exciting cause.’ And just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
so has it been with regard to prejudice at the North&mdash;when
there was no effort to obtain for the colored
man his <em>rights</em> as a man, as an American citizen, there
was no opposition exhibited, because it ‘laid dormant
for want of an exciting cause.’</p>

<p>I know it is alleged that some individuals, who
treated colored people with the greatest kindness a few
years ago, have, since abolition movements, had their
feelings so embittered towards them, that they have
withdrawn that kindness. Now I would ask, could
such people have acted from <em>principle</em>? Certainly
not; or nothing that others could do or say would
have driven them from the high ground they <em>appeared</em>
to occupy. No, my friend, they acted precisely
upon the false principle which thou hast recommended;
their <em>pity</em> was excited, their <em>sentiments of generosity</em>
were called into exercise, because they regarded
the colored man as an <em>unfortunate inferior</em>, rather
than as an <em>outraged</em> and <em>insulted equal</em>. Therefore,
as soon as abolitionists demanded for the oppressed
American the <em>very same treatment</em>, upon the high
ground of <em>human rights</em>, why, then it was instantly
withdrawn, simply because <em>it never had been conceded
on the right</em> ground; and those who had previously
granted it became afraid, lest, during the æra of abolition
excitement, persons would presume <em>they</em> were
acting on the fundamental principle of abolitionism&mdash;the
principle of <em>equal rights</em>, irrespective of color or
condition, instead of on the mere principle of ‘<em>pity</em>
and <em>generosity</em>.’</p>

<p>It is truly surprising to find a professing christian
excusing the unprincipled opposition exhibited in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Haven, to the erection of a College for young men of
color. Are we indeed to succumb to a corrupt public
sentiment at the North, and the abominations of slavery
at the South, by refraining from asserting the
<em>right</em> of Americans to plant a literary institution in
New Haven, or New York, or <em>any where</em> on the
American soil? Are we to select ‘some retired place,’
where there would be the least prejudice and opposition
to meet, rather than openly and fearlessly to face
the American monster, who, like the horse-leach, is
continually crying give, give, and whose demands are
only increased by compromise and surrender? No!
there is a spirit abroad in this country, which will not
consent to barter principle for an <em>unholy</em> peace; a
spirit which seeks to be ‘pure from the blood of all
men,’ by a bold and christian avowal of truth; a spirit
which will not hide God’s eternal principles of right
and wrong, but will stand erect in the storm of human
passion, prejudice and interest, ‘holding forth the light
of truth in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation;’
a spirit which will never slumber nor sleep,
till man ceases to hold dominion over his fellow creatures,
and the trump of universal liberty rings in every
forest, and is re-echoed by every mountain and rock.</p>

<p>Art thou not aware, my friend, that this College
was projected in the year 1831, previous to the formation
of the first Anti-Slavery Society, which was organized
in 1832? How, then, canst thou say that the
circumstances relative to it occurred ‘at a time when
the public mind was excited on the subject?’ I feel
quite amused at the <em>presumption</em> which thou appearest
to think was exhibited by the projectors of this institution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in wishing it to be located in New Haven,
where was another College ‘embracing a large proportion
of southern students,’ &amp;c. It was a great offence,
to be sure, for colored men to build a College
by the walls of the white man’s ‘College, where half
the shoe-blacks and waiters were <em>colored men</em>.’ But
why so? The other half of the shoe-blacks and waiters
were <em>white</em>, I presume; and if these <em>white</em> servants
could be satisfied with <em>their</em> humble occupation <em>under
the roof</em> of Yale College, why might not the colored
waiters be contented also, though an institution for the
education of colored Americans might <em>presume</em> to lift
its head ‘beside the very walls of this College?’ Is
it possible that any professing christian can calmly
look back at these disgraceful transactions, and tell
me that such opposition was manifested ‘<em>for the best
reasons</em>?’ And what is still worse, censure the projectors
of a literary institution, in free, republican, enlightened
America, because they did not meekly yield
to ‘<em>such reasonable objections</em>,’ and refused ‘to soothe
the feelings and apprehensions of those who had been
excited’ to opposition and clamor by the simple fact
that some American born citizens wished to give their
children a liberal education in a separate College, only
because the white Americans despised their brethren
of a darker complexion, and scorned to share with
them the privileges of Yale College? It was very
wrong, to be sure, for the friends of the oppressed
American to consider such outrageous conduct ‘as a
mark of the force of sinful prejudice!’ Vastly uncharitable!
Great complaints are made that ‘the
worst motives were ascribed to some of the most respectable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and venerated, and <em>pious</em> men who opposed
the measure.’ Wonderful indeed, that men should
be found so true to their principles, as to dare in this
age of sycophancy to declare the truth to those who
stand in high places, wearing the badges of office or
honor, and fearlessly to rebuke the puerile and unchristian
prejudice which existed against their colored
brethren! ‘Pious men!’ Why, I would ask, how
are we to judge of men’s piety&mdash;by professions or
products? Do men gather thorns of grapes, or thistles
of figs? Certainly not. If, then, in the lives of men
we do not find the fruits of christian principle, we
have no right, according to our Saviour’s criterion,
‘by their fruits ye shall know them,’ to suppose that
men are really pious who can be perseveringly guilty
of despising others, and denying them equal rights,
because they have colored skins. ‘A great deal
was said and done that was calculated to throw
the community into an angry ferment.’ Yes, and I
suppose the friends of the colored man were just as
guilty as was the great Apostle, who, by the angry,
and excited, and <em>prejudiced</em> Jews, was accused of
being ‘a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition,’ because
he declared himself called to preach the everlasting
gospel to the Gentiles, whom they considered
as ‘dogs,’ and utterly unworthy of being placed on the
same platform of human rights and a glorious immortality.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_VIII">LETTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">VINDICATION OF ABOLITIONISTS.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Groton</span>, Mass., <i>6th month, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:&mdash;In my last, I commented upon the
opposition to the establishment of a College in New
Haven, Conn., for the education of colored young
men. The same remarks are applicable to the persecutions
of the Canterbury School. I leave thee and
our readers to apply them. I cannot help thinking
how strange and unaccountable thy soft excuses for
the <em>sins of prejudice</em> will appear to the next generation,
if thy book ever reach their eye.</p>

<p>As to Cincinnati having been chosen as the city in
which the Philanthropist should be published after the
retreat of its editor from Kentucky, thou hast not been
‘sufficiently informed,’ for James G. Birney pursued
exactly the course which <em>thou</em> hast marked out as the
most prudent and least offensive. He edited his paper
at New Richmond, in Ohio, for nearly three months
before he went to Cincinnati, and did not go there
until the excitement appeared to have subsided.</p>

<p>And so, thou thinkest that abolitionists are accountable
for the outrages which have been committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
against them; they are the tempters, and are held responsible
by God, as well as the tempted. Wilt thou
tell me, who was responsible for the mob which went
with swords and staves to take an innocent man before
the tribunals of Annas and Pilate, some 1800
years ago? And who was responsible for the uproar
at Ephesus, the insurrection at Athens, and the tumults
at Lystra and Iconium? Were I a mobocrat, I
should want no better excuse than thou hast furnished
for such outrages. Wonderful indeed, if, in free
America, her citizens cannot <em>choose</em> where they will
erect their literary institutions and presses, to advocate
the self-evident truths of our Declaration of Independence!
And still more wonderful, that a New England
woman should, <em>after years of reflection</em>, deliberately
write a book to condemn the advocates of liberty,
and plead excuses for a relentless prejudice against
her colored brethren and sisters, and for the persecutors
of those, who, according to the opinion of a
<em>Southern</em> member of Congress, are prosecuting ‘the
<em>only plan</em> that can ever overthrow slavery at the
South.’ I am glad, <em>for thy own sake</em>, that thou hast
exculpated abolitionists from the charge of the ‘deliberate
intention of fomenting illegal acts of violence.’
Would it not have been still better, if thou hadst spared
the remarks which rendered such an explanation necessary?</p>

<p>I find that thou wilt not allow of the comparison
often drawn between the effects of christianity on the
hearts of those who obstinately rejected it, and those
of abolitionism on the hearts of people of the present
day. Thou sayest, ‘Christianity is a system of <em>persuasion</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
tending by kind and gentle influences to
make men <em>willing</em> to leave their sins.’ Dost thou
suppose the Pharisees and Sadducees deemed it was
very <em>kind</em> and <em>gentle</em> in its influences, when our holy
Redeemer called them ‘a generation of vipers,’ or
when he preached that sermon ‘full of harshness, uncharitableness,
rebuke and denunciation,’ recorded in
the xxiii. chapter of Matthew? But I shall be told
that Christ knew the hearts of all men, and therefore
it was right for him to use terms which mere human
beings never ought to employ. Read, then, the prophecies
of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and others, and also the
Epistles of the New Testament. They employed the
most offensive terms on many occasions, and the
sharpest rebukes, knowing full well that there are
some sinners who can be reached by nothing but
death-thrusts at their consciences. An anecdote of
<span class="smcap">John Richardson</span>, who was remarkable for his urbanity
of manners, occurs to me. He one day preached
a sermon in a country town, in which he made use of
some <em>hard</em> language; a friend reproved him after
meeting, and inquired whether he did not know that
hard wood was split by soft knocks. Yes, said Richardson,
but I also know that there is some wood so
rotten at the heart, that nothing but tremendously hard
blows will ever split it open. Ah! John, replied the
elder, I see thou understandest <em>how</em> to do thy master’s
work. Now, I believe this nation is <em>rotten at the
heart</em>, and that nothing but the most tremendous blows
with the sledge-hammer of abolition truth, could ever
have broken the false rest which we had taken up for
ourselves on the very brink of ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Abolitionism, on the contrary, is a system of <em>coercion</em>
by public opinion.’ By this assertion, I presume
thou ‘hast not been correctly informed’ as to
the reasons which have induced abolitionists to put
forth all their energies to rectify public opinion. It
is <em>not</em> because we wish to wield this public opinion
like a rod of iron over the heads of slaveholders, to
<em>coerce</em> them into an abandonment of the system of
slavery; not at all. We are striving to purify public
opinion, first, because as long as the North is so much
involved in the guilt of slavery, by its political, commercial,
religious, and social connexion with the
South, <em>her own citizens</em> need to be converted. Second,
because we know that when public opinion is rectified
at the North, it will throw a flood of light from its
million of reflecting surfaces upon the heart and soul
of the South. The South sees full well at what we
are aiming, and she is so unguarded as to acknowledge
that ‘if she does not resist the danger in its
inception, it will <em>soon</em> become <em>irresistible</em>.’ She exclaims
in terror, ‘the truth is, the <em>moral</em> power of the
world is against us; it is idle to disguise it.’ The
fact is, that the slaveholders of the South, and their
northern apologists, have been overtaken by the storm
of free discussion, and are something like those who
go down to the sea and do business in the great
waters: ‘they reel to and fro, and stagger like a
drunken man, and are at their wit’s end.’</p>

<p>Our view of the doctrine of expediency, thou art
pleased to pronounce ‘wrong and very pernicious in
its tendency.’ Expediency is emphatically the doctrine
by which the children of this world are wont to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
guide their steps, whilst the rejection of it as a rule
of action exactly accords with the divine injunction,
to ‘walk by faith, <em>not</em> by sight.’ Thy doctrine that
‘the wisdom and rectitude of a given course depend
entirely on the <em>probabilities of success</em>,’ is not the doctrine
of the Bible. According to this principle, how
absurd was the conduct of Moses! What probability
of success was there that he could move the heart of
Pharaoh? None at all; and thus did <em>he</em> reason
when he said, ‘Who am <em>I</em>, that I should go unto
Pharaoh?’ And again, ‘Behold, they will not believe
<em>me</em>, nor hearken unto my voice.’ The <em>success</em> of
Moses’s mission in persuading the king of Egypt to
‘let the people go,’ was not involved in the duty of
obedience to the divine command. Neither was the
success of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others of the prophets
who were singularly <em>unsuccessful</em> in their mission
to the Jews. All who see the path of duty plain
before them, are bound to walk in that path, end
where it may. They then can realize the meaning
of the Apostle, when he exhorts Christians to cast
all their burden on the Lord, with the promise that
He would sustain them. This is walking by <em>faith</em>,
not by sight. In the work in which abolitionists are
engaged, they are compelled to ‘walk by faith;’ they
feel called upon to preach the truth in season and
out of season, to lift up their voices like a trumpet,
to show the people their transgressions and the house
of Jacob their sins. The <em>success</em> of this mission, <em>they</em>
have no more to do with, than had Moses and Aaron,
Jeremiah or Isaiah, with that of theirs. Whether
the South will be saved by Anti-Slavery efforts, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
not a question for us to settle&mdash;and in some of our
hearts, the <em>hope of its salvation has utterly gone out</em>.
All nations have been punished for oppression, and
why should ours escape? Our light, and high professions,
and the age in which we live, convict us
not only of enormous oppression, but of the vilest
hypocrisy. It may be that the rejection of the truth
which we are now pouring in upon the South, may
be the final filling up of their iniquities, just previous
to the bursting of God’s exterminating thunders over
the Sodoms and Gomorrahs, the Admahs and Zeboims
of America. The <em>result</em> of our labors is hidden
from our eyes; whether the preaching of Anti-Slavery
truth is to be a savor of life unto life, or of
death unto death to this nation, we know not; and
we have no more to do with it, than had the Apostle
Paul, when he preached Christ to the people of his
day.</p>

<p>If American Slavery goes down in blood, it will
but verify the declarations of those who uphold it. A
committee of the North Carolina Legislature acknowledged
this to an English Friend ten years ago.
Jefferson more than once uttered his gloomy forebodings;
and the Legislators of Virginia, in 1832,
declared that if the opportunity of escape, through
the means of emancipation, were rejected, ‘though
they might <em>save themselves</em>, they would rear their posterity
to the business of the dagger and the torch.’ I
have myself known several families to leave the
South, solely from a fear of insurrection; and this
twelve and fourteen years ago, long before any Anti-Slavery
efforts were made in this country. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
yet, I presume, <em>if</em> through the cold-hearted apathy and
obstinate opposition of the North, the South should
become strengthened in her desperate determination
to hold on to her outraged victims, until they are
goaded to despair, and if the Lord in his wrath pours
out the vials of his vengeance upon the slave States,
why then, Abolitionists will have to bear all the
blame. Thou hast drawn a frightful picture of the
final issue of Anti-Slavery efforts, as thou art pleased
to call it; but none of these things move me, for
with just as much truth mayest thou point to the land
of Egypt, blackened by God’s avenging fires, and exclaim,
‘Behold the issue of Moses’s mission.’ Nay,
verily! See in that smoking, and blood-drenched
house of bondage, the consequences of oppression,
disobedience, and an obstinate rejection of truth, and
light, and love. What had Moses to do with those
judgment plagues, except to lift his rod? And if
the South soon finds her winding sheet in garments
rolled in blood, it will <em>not</em> be because of what the
North has told her, but because, like impenitent Egypt,
she hardened her heart against it, whilst the voices
of some of her own children were crying in agony,
‘O! that thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy
day, the things which belong to thy peace; but now
they are hid from thine eyes.’</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_IX">LETTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">EFFECT ON THE SOUTH.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Brookline</span>, Mass., <i>8th month, 17th, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:&mdash;Thou sayest ‘There are cases also,
where differences in age, and station, and character,
forbid all interference to modify the conduct and character
of others.’ Let us bring this to the only touchstone
by which Christians should try their principles
of action.</p>

<p>How was it when God designed to rid his people
out of the hands of the Egyptian monarch? Was <em>his</em>
station so exalted ‘as to forbid all interference to modify
his character and conduct?’ And <em>who</em> was sent to
interfere with his conduct towards a stricken people?
Was it some brother monarch of exalted station,
whose elevated rank might serve to excuse such interference
‘to modify his conduct and character?’
No. It was an obscure shepherd of Midian’s desert;
for let us remember, that Moses, in pleading the cause
of the Israelites, identified himself with the <em>lowest</em> and
<em>meanest</em> of the King’s subjects. Ah! he was <em>one of
that despised caste</em>; for, although brought up as the
son of the princess, yet he had left Egypt as an outlaw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
He had committed the crime of murder, and
fled because the monarch ‘sought to slay him.’ This
exiled outlaw is the instrument chosen by God to vindicate
the cause of his oppressed people. Moses was
in the sight of Pharaoh as much an object of scorn,
as Garrison now is to the tyrants of America. Some
seem to think, that great moral enterprises can be
made honorable only by Doctors of Divinity, and
Presidents of Colleges, engaging in them: when all
powerful Truth cannot be dignified by <em>any</em> man, but
<em>it</em> dignifies and ennobles all who embrace it. <em>It</em> lifts
the beggar from the dunghill, and sets him among
princes. Whilst it needs no great names to bear it
onward to its glorious consummation, it is continually
making great characters out of apparently mean and
unpromising materials; and in the intensity of its
piercing rays, revealing to the amazement of many,
the insignificance and <em>moral</em> littleness of those who
fill the highest stations in Church and State.</p>

<p>But take a few more examples from the bible, of
those in high stations being reproved by men of inferior
rank. Look at David rebuked by Nathan,
Ahab and Jezebel by Elijah and Micaiah. What,
too, was the conduct of Daniel and Shadrach, Meshack
and Abednego, but a <em>practical</em> rebuke of Darius
and Nebuchadnezzar? And <em>who</em> were these men,
apart from these acts of daring interference? They
were the Lord’s prophets, I shall be told; but what
cared those monarchs for <em>this fact</em>? How much credit
did they give them for holding this holy office? None.
And why? Because all but David were impenitent
sinners, and rejected with scorn all ‘interference to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
modify their conduct or characters.’ Reformers are
rarely estimated in the age in which they live,
whether they be called prophets or apostles, or abolitionists,
or what not. They stand on the rock of
Truth, and calmly look down upon the careering
thunder-clouds, the tempest, and the roaring waves,
because they well know that where the atmosphere
is surcharged with pestilential vapors, a conflict of
the elements <em>must</em> take place, before it can be purified
by that moral electricity, beautifully typified by the
cloven tongues that sat upon <em>each</em> of the heads of the
120 disciples who were convened on the day of Pentecost.
Such men and women expect to be ‘blamed
and opposed, because their measures are deemed inexpedient,
and calculated to increase rather than diminish
the evil to be cured.’ They know full well,
that <em>intellectual</em> greatness cannot give <em>moral</em> perception&mdash;therefore,
<em>those who have no clear views of the
irresistibleness of moral power, cannot see the efficacy
of moral means</em>. They say with the apostle, ‘The
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can
he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.’
We know full well, that northern men and women
laugh at the inefficacy of Anti-Slavery measures;
<em>but slaveholders never have ridiculed them</em>: not that
their moral perceptions are any clearer than those of
our northern opponents, but where men’s <em>interests</em>
and <em>lust of power</em> are immediately affected by moral
effort, they instinctively feel that it is so, and tremble
for the result.</p>

<p>But suppose even that our measures were calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to <em>increase</em> the evils of slavery. <em>The measures
adopted by Moses, and sanctioned by God, increased
the burdens of the Israelites.</em> Were they, therefore,
<em>inexpedient</em>? And yet, if <em>our</em> measures produce a
similar effect, O then! they are very inexpedient indeed.
The truth is, when we look at Moses and his
measures, we look at them in connection with the
emancipation of the Israelites. The <em>ultimate</em> and
glorious success of the measures proves their wisdom
and expediency. But when Anti-Slavery measures
are looked at <em>now</em>, we see them long <em>before the end
is accomplished</em>. We see, according to thy account,
the burdens increased; but we do not yet see the
triumphant march through the Red Sea, nor do we
hear the song of joy and thanksgiving which ascended
from Israel’s redeemed host. But canst thou not
give us twenty years to complete our work? Clarkson,
thy much admired model, worked twenty years;
and the benevolent Colonization Society has been in
operation twenty years. Just give us as long a time,
or half that time, and then thou wilt be a far better
judge of the expediency or inexpediency of our measures.
Then thou wilt be able to look at them in
connection with their success or their failure, and
instead of writing a book on thy opinions and my
opinions, thou canst write a <em>history</em>.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with thee in the sentiment, that the
station of a nursery maid makes it inexpedient for her
to turn reprover of the master who employs her.
This is the doctrine of <em>modern aristocracy</em>, not of
primitive christianity; for ecclesiastical history informs
us that, in the first ages of christianity, kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
were converted through the faithful and solemn rebukes
of their slaves and captives. I have myself
been reproved by a <em>slave</em>, and I thanked her, and still
thank her for it. Think how this doctrine robs the
nursery maid of her responsibility, and shields the
master from reproof; for it may be that she alone
has seen him ill-treat his wife. Now it appears to
me, so far from her station forbidding all interference
to modify the character and conduct of her employer,
that that station peculiarly qualifies her for the difficult
and delicate task, because nursery maids often know
secrets of oppression, which no other persons are fully
acquainted with. For my part, I believe it is <em>now
the duty of the slaves of the South to rebuke their
masters</em> for their robbery, oppression and crime; and
so far from believing that such ‘reproof would do no
good, but only evil,’ I think it would be attended by
the happiest results in the main, though I doubt not
it would occasion some instances of severe personal
suffering. No station or character can destroy individual
responsibility, in the matter of reproving sin.
I feel that a slave has a right to rebuke me, and so
has the vilest sinner; and the sincere, humble christian
will be thankful for rebuke, let it come from
whom it may. Such, I am confident, never would
think it inexpedient for their chamber maids to administer
it, but would endeavor to profit by it.</p>

<p>Thou askest very gravely, why James G. Birney
did not go quietly into the southern States, and collect
facts? Indeed! Why should he go to the
South to collect facts, when he had lived there forty
years? Thou mayest with just as much propriety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
ask me, why I do not go to the South to collect facts.
The answer to both questions is obvious:&mdash;We have
lived at the South, as <em>integral</em> parts of the system of
slavery, and therefore we know from practical observation
and sad experience, quite enough about it already.
I think it would be absurd for either of us to
spend our time in such a way. And even if J. G.
Birney had not lived at the South, why should he
go there to collect facts, when the Anti-Slavery presses
are continually throwing them out before the public?
Look, too, at the Slave Laws! What more do we
need to show us the bloody hands and iron heart of
Slavery?</p>

<p>Thou sayest on the 89th page of thy book, ‘Every
avenue of approach to the South is shut. No paper,
pamphlet, or preacher, that touches on that topic, is
admitted in their bounds.’ Thou art greatly mistaken;
every avenue of approach to the South is <em>not</em>
shut. The American Anti-Slavery Society sends
between four and five hundred of its publications to
the South by mail, <em>to subscribers</em>, or as exchange
papers. One slaveholder in North Carolina, not
long since, bought $60 worth of our pamphlets, &amp;c.
which he distributed in the slave States. Another
slaveholder from Louisiana, made a large purchase
of our publications last fall, which he designed to
distribute among professors of religion who held
slaves. To these I may add another from South
Carolina, another from Richmond, Virginia, numbers
from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri, and others
from New Orleans, besides persons connected with
at least three Colleges and Theological Seminaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in slave States, have applied for our publications for
their own use, and for distribution. Within a few
weeks, the South Carolina Delegation in Congress
have sent on an order to the publishing Agent of the
American Anti-Slavery Society, for all the principal
bound volumes, pamphlets, and periodicals of the
Society. At the same time, they addressed a very
courteous letter to J. G. Birney, the Corresponding
Secretary, propounding nearly a score of queries,
embracing the principles, designs, plans of operation,
progress and results of the Society. I know in the
large cities, such as Charleston and Richmond, that
Anti-Slavery papers are not suffered to reach their
destination through the mail; but <em>it is not so</em> in the
smaller towns. But even in the cities, I doubt not
they are read by the postmasters and others. The
South may pretend that she will not read our papers,
but it is all pretence; the fact is, she is very anxious
to see what we are doing, so that when the mail-bags
were robbed in Charleston in 1835, <em>I know</em> that the
robbers were very careful to select a few copies of
each of the publications <em>before</em> they made the bonfire,
and that these were handed round in a private way
through the city, so that they were <em>extensively read</em>.
This fact I had from a friend of mine who was in
Charleston at the time, and <em>read</em> the publications
himself. My relations also wrote me word, that they
had seen and read them.</p>

<p>In order to show that our discussions and publications
have already produced a great effect upon many
individuals in the slave States, I subjoin the following
detail of facts and testimony now in my possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>My sister, S. M. Grimké, has just received a letter
from a Southerner residing in the far South, in which
he says, ‘On the 4th of July, the friends of the oppressed
met and contributed six or eight dollars, to
obtain some copies of Gerrit Smith’s letter, and some
other pamphlets for our own benefit and that of the
vicinity. The leaven, we think, is beginning to
work, and we hope that it will ere long purify the
whole mass of corruption.’</p>

<p>An intelligent member of the Methodist Church,
who resides in North Carolina, was recently in the
city of New York, and told the editor of Zion’s
Watchman, that ‘our publications were read with
great interest at the South&mdash;that there was great
curiosity there to see them.’ A bookseller also in
one of the most southern States, only a few months
ago, ordered a package of our publications. And
within a very short time, an influential slaveholder
from the far South, who called at the Anti-Slavery
Office in New York, said he had had misgivings on
the subject ever since the formation of the American
Society&mdash;that he saw some of our publications <em>at the
South</em> three years ago, and is now convinced and has
emancipated his slaves.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the Union Herald, a clergyman,
and a graduate of one of the colleges of Kentucky,
says, ‘I find in this State <em>many</em> who are decidedly
opposed to slavery&mdash;but few indeed take the ground
that it is right. I trust the cause of human rights is
onward&mdash;<em>weekly, I receive two copies of the Emancipator</em>,
which I send out as battering rams, to beat
down the citadel of oppression.’ In a letter to James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
G. Birney, from a gentleman in a slave State, we
find this declaration: ‘Your paper, the Philanthropist,
is regularly distributed here, and as yet works
no incendiary results; and indeed, so far as I can
learn, general satisfaction is here expressed, both as
to the temper and spirit of the paper, and no disapprobation
as to the results.’ At an Anti-Slavery
meeting last fall in Philadelphia, a gentleman from
Delaware was present, who rose and encouraged
Abolitionists to go on, and said that he could assure
them the influence of their measures was felt there,
and their principles were gaining ground secretly and
silently. The subject, he informed them, was discussed
there, and he believed Anti-Slavery lectures could
be delivered there with safety, and would produce
important results. Since that time, a lecturer has
been into that State, and a State Society has been
formed, the secretary of which was the first editor of
the Emancipator, and is now pastor of the Baptist
church in the capital of the State. The North Carolina
Watchman, published at Salisbury, in an article
on the subject of Abolition, has the following remarks
of the editor: ‘It [the abolition party] is the growing
party at the North: we are inclined to believe, that
there is even <em>more of it at the South</em>, than prudence
will permit to be openly avowed.’ It rejoices our
hearts to find that there are some southerners who
feel and acknowledge the infatuation of the politicians
of the South, and the philanthropy of abolitionists.
The Maryville Intelligencer of 1836, exclaims,
‘What sort of madness, produced by a jaundiced and
distorted conception of the feelings and motives by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
which northern abolitionists are actuated, can induce
the southern political press to urge a severance of the
tie that binds our Union together? To offer rewards
for those very individuals who stand as <em>mediators</em> between
masters and slaves, urging the one to be obedient,
and the other to do justice?’</p>

<p>A southern Minister of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, at the session of the New York Annual Conference,
in June of 1836, said: ‘Don’t give up Abolitionism&mdash;don’t
bow down to slavery. You have
thousands at the South who are secretly praying for
you.’ In a subsequent conversation with the same
individual, he stated, that the South is not that unit
of which the pro-slavery party boast&mdash;there is a diversity
of opinion among them in reference to slavery,
and the <span class="smcapuc">REIGN OF TERROR</span> alone suppresses the free
expression of sentiment. That there are thousands
who believe slaveholding to be sinful, who secretly
wish the abolitionists success, and believe God will
bless their efforts. That the ministers of the gospel
and ecclesiastical bodies who indiscriminately denounce
the abolitionists, without doing any thing
themselves to remove slavery, have <em>not</em> the thanks of
thousands at the South, but on the contrary are viewed
as <em>taking sides with slaveholders</em>, and <em>recreant to the
principles of their own profession</em>.&mdash;<cite>Zion’s Watchman,
November, 1836.</cite></p>

<p>The Christian Mirror, published in Portland, Maine,
has the following letter from a minister who has lately
taken up his abode in Kentucky, to a friend in Maine:&mdash;‘Several
ministers have recently left the State, I
believe, on account of slavery; and many of the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of churches, as I have understood, have sold their
property, and removed to the free States. Many are
becoming more and more convinced of the evil and <em>sin</em>
of slavery, and would gladly rid themselves and the
community of this scourge; and I feel confident that
influences are already in operation, which, if properly
directed and regulated by the principles of the gospel,
may ‘break every yoke and let the oppressed go free’
in Kentucky.</p>

<p>In 1st month, 1835, when Theodore D. Weld was
lecturing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the close of
one of his evening lectures, a man sought him through
the crowd, and extending his hand to him through his
friends, by whom he was surrounded, solicited him to
step aside with him for a moment. After they had
retired by themselves, the gentleman said to him with
great earnestness, ‘I am a slaveholder from Maryland&mdash;<em>you
are right&mdash;the doctrine you advocate is truth</em>.’
Why, then, said the lecturer, do you not emancipate
your slaves? ‘Because,’ said the Marylander, ‘I
have not religion enough’&mdash;He was a professing
christian&mdash;‘I dare not subject myself to the torrent of
opposition which, from the present state of public sentiment,
would be poured upon me; but do you abolitionists
go on, and you will effect a change in public
sentiment, which will render it possible and easy for
us to emancipate our slaves. I know,’ continued he,
‘a great many slaveholders in my State, who stand
on precisely the same ground that I do in relation to
this matter. <em>Only produce a correct public sentiment
at the North and the work is done; for all that keeps
the South in countenance while continuing this system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is the apology and argument afforded so generally
by the North; only produce a right feeling in
the North generally, and the South cannot stand before
it; let the North be thoroughly converted, and
the work is at once accomplished at the South.</em>’
Another fact which may be adduced to prove that the
South is looking to the North for help, is the following:
At an Anti-Slavery concert of prayer for the oppressed,
held in New York city, in 1836, a gentleman
arose in the course of the meeting, declaring himself
a Virginian and a slaveholder. He said he came to
that city filled with the deepest prejudice against the
abolitionists, by the reports given of their character in
papers published at the North. But he determined
to investigate their character and designs for himself.
He even boarded in the family of an abolitionist, and
attended the monthly concert of prayer for the slaves
and the slaveholders. And now, as the result of his
investigations and observations, he was convinced that
<em>not only the spirit but the principles and measures of
the abolitionists</em> ARE RIGHTEOUS. He was now
ready to emancipate his own slaves, and had commenced
advocating the doctrine of immediate emancipation&mdash;‘and
here,’ said he, pointing to two men sitting
near him, ‘are the first fruits of my labors&mdash;these two
fellow Virginians and slaveholders, are converts with
myself to abolitionism. And I know a thousand Virginians,
who need only to be made acquainted with
the true spirit and principles of abolitionists, in order
to their becoming converts as we are. <em>Let the abolitionists
go on in the dissemination of their doctrines,
and let the Northern papers cease to misrepresent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
them at the South&mdash;let the true light of abolitionism
be fully shed upon the Southern mind, and the work
of immediate and general emancipation will be speedily
accomplished.</em>‘&mdash;<cite>Morning Star, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>A letter from a gentleman in Kentucky to Gerrit
Smith, dated August, 1836, contains the following expressions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I am fully persuaded, that the voice of the free
States, lifted up in a proper manner against the evil,
[Slavery] will awaken them [slaveholders] from their
midnight slumbers, and produce a happy change. I
rejoice, dear brother in Christ, to hear that you are
with us, and feel deeply to plead the cause of the oppressed,
and undo the heavy burdens. May God bless
you, and the cause which you pursue.’</p>

</div>

<p>In the summer of 1835, William R. Buford, of Virginia,
who had then recently emancipated his slaves,
wrote a letter which was published in the Hampshire
Gazette, North Hampton, Mass. from which I give
thee some extracts.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;As you are ardently engaged in the
discussion of Slavery, I think it likely I may be of
service to you, and through you to the cause which
you are advocating. … I was born and brought
up at the South in the midst of slavery, as you know.
My father inherited slaves from his father, and I from
him. So far from thinking slavery a sin, or that I
had no right to own the slaves inherited from my
father, I thought no one could venture to dispute that
right, any more than he could my right to his land or
his stock. I advocated Colonization, as I thought it
on many accounts a good plan to get rid of such colored
persons as wished to go to Africa; but my conscience
as a slaveholder was not much troubled by it.
Of course, I had no tendency to make me disclaim my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
right to my slaves. Abolition&mdash;immediate abolition,
began afterwards to be discussed in various parts of
the country. My right to the slaves I owned began
to be disputed. I had to defend myself. In vain did
I say I inherited my slaves from a pious father, who
seemed to be governed in his dealings by a sense of
duty to his slaves. In vain did I say that nearly all
my property consisted in slaves, and to free them
would make me a poor man. My duty to emancipate
was still urged. At length my eyes were opened&mdash;partly
by the arguments used by the abolitionists: but
mainly, by long being compelled <em>by them</em> to examine
the subject for myself. No longer could I close my
eyes to the evils of slavery, nor could I any longer
despise the abolitionists, ‘the only true friends of their
country and kind.’ I now think, I know, I have no
more right to own slaves, whether I inherited them or
not, than I have to encourage the African slave trade.
By declaring this sentiment, I expect and design to
abet the cause of Abolition at the North, and through
the North the emancipation of the slaves at the South.
I know that in doing this, I condemn the South. No
one can suppose, however, that I have any unkind
feelings towards the South. All my relatives live
in the slaveholding States, and are almost all slaveholders.</p>

<p>I think the abolitionists have done, and are doing a
great deal of good, by holding slavery up to the public
gaze. Sentiment at the North on the subject of
slavery must have the same effect on the South, that
their opinions have on any other matter.’</p>

</div>

<p>The writer of the foregoing is, as I am told, still a
resident of Virginia, where he has long been known,
and is highly respected.</p>

<p>In the 11th month, 1835, the United States Telegraph,
published at Washington city, contains the following
remarks by the Editor, Duff Green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘We are of those who believe the South has nothing
to fear from a servile war. We do not believe that
the abolitionists intend, nor could they if they would,
excite the slaves to insurrection. The danger of this
is remote. We believe that we have most to fear
from the <em>organised action upon the consciences</em> and
fears of the slaveholders themselves; <em>from the insinuations
of their dangerous heresies into our schools,
our pulpits, and our domestic circles. It is only by
alarming the consciences of the weak and feeble, and
diffusing among our own people a morbid sensibility
on the question of slavery, that the abolitionists can
accomplish their object.</em> <span class="smcap">Preparatory to this</span>, they
are now laboring to saturate the non-slaveholding
States with the belief that slavery is a ‘sin against
God.’ We must meet the question in all its bearings.
We must <span class="smcapuc">SATISFY THE CONSCIENCES</span>, we must allay the
fears of our own people. We must satisfy them that
slavery is of itself right&mdash;that it is not a sin against
God&mdash;that it is not an evil, moral or political. To
do this, we must discuss the subject of slavery itself.
We must examine its bearing upon the moral, political,
and religious institutions of the country. In this
way, and this way only, can we prepare our own people
to <em>defend their own institutions</em>.’</p>

</div>

<p>In another number of the same paper, the Editor
says,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘We hold that our sole reliance is on ourselves;
that we have <em>most to fear from the gradual operation
on public opinion among ourselves</em>; and that those are
the most insidious and dangerous invaders of our
rights and interests, who, coming to us in the guise of
friendship, endeavor to <em>persuade</em> us that slavery is a
sin, a curse, an evil. It is not true that the South
sleeps on a volcano&mdash;that we are afraid to go to bed
at night&mdash;that we are fearful of murder and pillage.
<em>Our greatest cause of apprehension is from the operation
of the morbid sensibility which appeals to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
consciences of our own people</em>, and would make them
the voluntary instruments of their own ruin.’</p>

</div>

<p>In 1835, I think about the close of the year, a series
of articles on Slavery appeared in the Lexington (Kentucky)
Intelligencer. In one of the numbers, the writer
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Much of the preceding matter was inserted (May,
1833) in the Louisville Herald. A <em>great change</em> has
since taken place in public sentiment. Colonization,
then a favorite measure, is now rejected for instant
emancipation. Were this last feasible, I would gladly
join its advocates,’ &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>In a letter to the publisher of the Emancipator,
dated ‘April 1, 1837,’ from a Southerner, I find the
following language:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Though a &mdash;&mdash; born and bred, I now consider the
Anti-Slavery cause as a just and holy one. Deep reflection,
the reading of your excellent publications, and&mdash;years
of travel in Europe, have made me, what I
am now proud to call myself, an abolitionist.</p>

<p>‘For the present, accept the assurances of my unswerving
devotion to the cause of liberty and justice.
Any letter from yourself will always give me sincere
pleasure, and whenever I go to New York, I shall call
upon you, <em>sans ceremonie</em>, as I would upon an old
friend.’</p>

</div>

<p>A short time since, J. G. Birney received a donation
of $20 for the Anti-Slavery Society, from an individual
residing in a slave State, accompanied with
a request that his name might not be mentioned.</p>

<p>About the time of the robbery of the U. S. Mail,
and the burning of Abolition papers by the infatuated
citizens of my own city, the Editor of the Charleston
Courier made the following remarks in his paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which plainly reveal the cowering of the spirit of slavery,
under the searching scrutiny occasioned by the
Anti-Slavery discussions in the free States.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<em>Mart for Negroes.</em>&mdash;We understand that a proposition
is before the city council, relative to the establishment
of a mart for the sale of negroes in this city,
in a place <em>more remote from observation</em>, and less offensive
to the public eye, than the one now used for
that purpose. We doubt not that the proposition before
the council will be acceptable to the community,
and that it may be so matured as to promote public
decency, without prejudice to the interest of individuals.’</p>

</div>

<p>Hear, too, the acknowledgement of the Southern
Literary Review, published at Charleston, South Carolina,
which was got up in 1837, to sustain the system
of Slavery.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘There are <em>many</em> good men even among us, who
have begun to grow <em>timid</em>. They think that what
the virtuous and high-minded men of the North look
upon as a crime and a plague-spot, cannot be perfectly
innocent or quite harmless in a slaveholding community.
… Some timid men among us, whose ears
have been long assailed with outcries of tyranny and
oppression, wafted over the ocean and land from North
to South, begin to look <em>fearfully</em> around them.’</p>

</div>

<p>A correspondent of the Pittsburgh Witness, detailing
the particulars of an Anti-Slavery meeting in Washington
co. Pennsylvania, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘After Dr. Lemoyne,
the President of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society,
had finished his address, in which the principles
and measures of the Anti-Slavery Society were fully
exhibited, the Rev. Charles Stewart, of Kentucky, a
slaveholding clergyman of the Presbyterian church,
who was casually present, rose and addressed the audience,
and instead of opposing our principles as might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
have been expected, fully endorsed every thing that
had been said, declaring his conviction that such a
speech would have been well received by the truly religious
part of the community in which he resided,
and would have been opposed only by those who were
actuated by party politics alone, or those who ‘neither
feared God nor regarded man.’</p>

</div>

<p>I give thee now a letter from a gentleman in a
South Western slaveholding State, to <span class="smcap">J. G. Birney</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<em>Very Dear Sir</em>:&mdash;I knew you in the days of your
prosperity at the South, though you will not recognize
me. Ever since you first took your stand in defence
of <em>natural rights</em>, I have been looking upon you with
intense interest. I <em>was</em> violently opposed to Abolitionists,
and verily thought I was doing service to
both church and State, in decrying them as <em>incendiaries</em>
and <em>fanatics</em>. What blindness and infatuation!
Yet I was <em>sincere</em>. Ah! my dear sir, God in mercy
has taught me that something more than <em>sincerity</em>, in
the common acceptation of the term, is necessary to
preserve our understandings from idiocy, and our
hearts from utter ruin. How could I have been such
a <em>madman</em>, as coolly and composedly to place my foot
upon the necks of immortal beings, and from that
horrid point of elevation, hurl the deep curses of
church and State at the heads of&mdash;&mdash;whom? Fanatics?
No, sir!&mdash;<em>but of the only persons on the
face of the earth, who had <span class="smcapuc">HEART</span> enough to <span class="smcapuc">FEEL</span>, and
<span class="smcapuc">SOUL</span> enough to <span class="smcapuc">ACT</span>, in behalf of the RIGHTS OF
MAN</em>! Yet I was just such a madman! Yes, sir,
I was a <em>fanatic</em>, and an <em>incendiary</em> too&mdash;setting on
fire the worst passions of our fallen nature. But I
have repented. I have become a convert to political,
and I trust, also, to <em>Christian Freedom</em>. The spectacle
exhibited by yourself, and your compatriots and
fellow-christians, has completely overcome me. Your
reasonings convince my judgment, and your <span class="smcapuc">ACTIONS</span>
win my heart. God speed you in your work of love!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The hopes of the world depend, under God, upon the
success of your cause.</p>

<p>Very respectfully and with undying affection,</p>

<p class="pre-signature">Your friend and brother,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">A Southerner</span>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Another of J. G. Birney’s southern correspondents
says, in 1836,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘That portion of the Church with which I am connected,
seem to have no sympathy with the indignation
against the abolitionists, which prevails so extensively
North and South; but, on the other hand, consider
the <em>South</em> as <em>infatuated</em> to the highest degree.</p>

<p>There is more credit for philanthropy given those
who manumit their slaves, without <em>expatriation</em>, than
formerly.</p>

<p>The thirst for information is increasing, while the
‘<em>non liquetism</em>’ [voting on neither side] of brethren in
church courts is becoming less and less satisfactory;
and such of them as advocate the perpetuity of the
system, are looked upon with surprise and regret.</p>

<p>Those who view with horror the traffic in slaves
by ministers of the gospel, express more freely their
pain at its indulgence, <em>than I have ever known</em>. I
am acquainted with several such cases. In no instances
have they left the brother’s standing where it
was, before it took place. Of such cases&mdash;even those,
too, where the usual allowances might be called for&mdash;I
have heard professors of religion remark, ‘Mr. A.
could not get an audience to hear him preach’&mdash;‘Mr.
B. has more assurance than I could have, to preach,
after selling my slaves as he has done’&mdash;‘He can
never make me believe he has any religion’&mdash;‘This
is the first time you have done so, but repeat it, and I
think I shall never hear you preach again.’</p>

</div>

<p>These remarks were made by slaveholding professors
of religion themselves, and under circumstances
neither calculated nor intended to deceive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The following letter was written by an intelligent
gentleman in the interior of Alabama, to Arthur Tappan,
of New York, who had sent him some Anti-Slavery
publications. The date is March 21, 1834.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Dear Sir&mdash;Your letter of Dec. last, I read with
much interest. The numbers of the Anti-Slavery
Reporter, also, which you were so kind as to send
me, I carefully examined, and put them in circulation.</p>

<p>Your operations have produced considerable excitement
in some sections of this country, but humanity
has lost nothing. The more the subject of slavery is
agitated, the better. A distinguished gentleman remarked
to me a day or two since, that ‘there was a
great change going on in public sentiment.’ Few
would acknowledge that it was to be ascribed to the
influence of your Society. There can be no doubt,
however, that this is directly and indirectly the principal
cause.’</p>

</div>

<p>During the same year, the Editor of the New York
Evangelist received a letter from a christian friend in
North Carolina, from which I give thee an extract.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>To the Editor of the Evangelist</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The subject of slavery, recently brought up and
discussed in your paper, is the one which elicits the
following remarks.</p>

<p>In the first place I will state, that I entertain very
different views <em>now</em>, to what I did six months ago. I
was among those who thought (and honestly too) that
there was no more moral guilt attached to the holding
our fellow beings in bondage, regarding them as property,
than to the holding of a mule or an ox. It was
natural enough for me to think so, for I had been
trained from my very infancy to view the subject in
no other light. I shall never forget my feelings when
the subject was first hit upon in the Evangelist. I
became angry, and was disposed to attribute sinister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
motives to all who were concerned in the matter.
With some others, I determined to stop the paper
forthwith.</p>

<p>Though I made every effort to turn my mind away
from the subject, my conscience in spite of me began
to awake, and to be troubled. The word of God was
resorted to, with the hope of finding something to
bring peace and quietude, but all in vain. It was but
adding fuel to the flame. I determined, let others do
as they would, to meet the subject, to examine it in all
its bearings, and to abide the result; and if it should
be found that God regards slavery as an evil, and incompatible
with the gospel, I would give it up. If
not, I should be made wiser without incurring any
harm by the investigation.</p>

<p>In the very nature of God’s dealings with men, this
subject must and will be agitated, until conviction
shall be brought home to the heart and conscience of
every man, and <em>slavery shall be banished from our
land</em>. And woe be to him who wilfully closes his
eyes, and stops his ears against the light of God’s
truth.’</p>

</div>

<p>In 8th month of the same year, the same paper
contained the following extract from another correspondent
in North Carolina.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">&mdash;&mdash; N. C. July 9, 1834.</span></p>

<p>‘Rev. and dear Sir&mdash;If I owe an apology for intruding
on you, and introducing myself, I must find it
in the fact, that I wish to bid you God speed in the
good cause in which you are so heartily engaged.
While so many at the North are opposing, I wish to
cheer you by one voice from the South. If it is unpopular
to plead the cause of the oppressed negro in
New York, how dangerous to be known as his friend
in the far South, where, as a correspondent in the
Evangelist justly observes, a minister cannot enforce
the law of love, without being suspected of favoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
emancipation. I am glad the people with you are
beginning to feel and to act. I pray God that you
may go on with all the light and love of the gospel,
and that the cry of ‘Let us alone,’ will not frighten
you from your labor of love.’</p>

</div>

<p>James A. Thome, a Presbyterian clergyman, a native,
and still a resident of Kentucky, said in a speech
at New York, at the Anniversary of the American
Anti-Slavery Society in 1834:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Under all these disadvantages, you are doing
much. The very little leaven which you have been
enabled to introduce, is now working with tremendous
power. One instance has lately occurred within
my acquaintance, of an heir to slave property&mdash;a
young man of growing influence, who was first
awakened by reading a single number of the Anti-Slavery
Reporter, sent to him by some unknown
hand. He is now a whole-hearted abolitionist. I
have facts to show that cases of this kind are by no
means rare. A family of slaves in Arkansas Territory,
another in Tennessee, and a third, consisting of
88, in Virginia, were successively emancipated through
the influence of one abolition periodical. Then do
not hesitate as to duty. Do not pause to consider
the propriety of interference. It is as unquestionably
the province of the North to labor in this cause, as it
is the duty of the church to convert the world. The
call is urgent&mdash;it is imperative. We want light.
The ungodly are saying, ‘the church will not enlighten
us.’ The church is saying, ‘the ministry will
not enlighten us.’ The ministry is crying, ‘Peace&mdash;take
care.’ We are altogether covered in gross
darkness. We appeal to you for light. Send us
facts&mdash;send us kind remonstrance and manly reasoning.
We are perishing for lack of truth. We
have been lulled to sleep by the guilty apologist.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>A letter from a Post Master in Virginia, to the
editor of ‘Human Rights,’ dated August 15, 1835,
contains the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I have received two numbers of Human Rights,
and one of The Emancipator. I have read and loaned
them, had them returned, and loaned again. I
can see no unsoundness in the arguments there advanced&mdash;and
until I can see some evil in your publications,
I shall distribute all you send to this office.
It is certainly high time this subject was examined,
and viewed in its proper light. I know these publications
will displease those who hold their fellow men
in bondage: but reason, truth and justice are on
your side&mdash;and why should you seek the good will
of any who do evil?</p>

<p>I would be pleased to have a copy of the last Report
of the Am. Anti-Slavery Society, if convenient, and
some of your other pamphlets, which you have to distribute
gratis. I will read and use them to the best
advantage.’</p>

</div>

<p>A gentleman of Middlesex County, Mass. whose
house is one of my New England homes, told me that
he had very recently met with a slaveholder from the
South, who, during a warm discussion on the subject
of slavery, made the following acknowledgment: ‘The
worst of it is, <em>we have fanatics among ourselves</em>, and
we don’t know what to do with them, for they are <em>increasing
fast</em>, and are sustained in their opposition to
slavery by the Abolitionists of the North.’</p>

<p>A Baptist clergyman whom I met in Worcester
County, Mass., a few months since, told me that his
brother-in-law, a lawyer of New Orleans, who had
recently paid him a visit, took up the Report of the
Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, and read it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
great interest. He then inquired, whether the principles
set forth in that document were Anti-Slavery
principles. Upon being informed that they were, he
expressed his entire approbation of them, and full
conviction that they would prevail as soon as the
South understood them; for, said he, they are the principles
of truth and justice, and must finally triumph.
This gentleman requested to be furnished with some
of our publications, and carried them to the South
with him.</p>

<p>There certainly can be no doubt to a reflecting and
candid mind, as to what will and <em>must</em> be the result
of Anti-Slavery operations. Hear now the opinion
of one of the leading political papers in Charleston,
South Carolina, the Southern Patriot.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘While agitation is <em>permitted</em> in Congress, there is
<em>no security for the South</em>. While discussion is <em>allowed</em>
in that body, year after year, in relation to slavery
and its incidents, the rights of property at the
South <em>must, in the lapse of a short period, be undermined</em>.
It is the weapon of all who expect to work
out <em>great changes in public opinion</em>. It was the instrument
by which <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span> gradually shook the
fabric of popular prejudice in England on the Catholic
question. His sole instrument was agitation, both
in Parliament and out of it. His constant counsel to
his followers was, agitate! agitate! They did agitate.
They happily carried the question of Catholic
rights.</p>

<p>Agitation may be successfully employed for a bad
as well as good cause. What was the weapon of the
English abolitionists?&mdash;Agitation. Regard the question
of the abolition of the slave trade when first
brought into Parliament&mdash;behold the influence of
PITT and the tory party beating down its advocates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
by an overwhelming majority! Look at the question
of abolition itself, twenty years after, and you see
<span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span> and his adherents carrying the question
itself of <em>abolition of slavery</em>, by a majority as triumphant!
How was all this accomplished?&mdash;By agitation
in Parliament! It was on this ample theatre
that the abolitionists worked their fatal spells. It
was on this wide stage of discussion that they spoke
to the people of England in that voice of fanaticism,
which, at length, found an echo that suited their purposes.
It was through the debates, which circulated
by means of the press throughout every corner of the
realm, that they carried that question to its extremest
borders, to the hamlet of every peasant in the empire.
Can it then be expected, if we give the American
abolitionists the same advantage of that wide field of
debate which Congress affords, that the <em>same results</em>
will not follow? The local legislatures are limited
theatres of action. Their debates are comparatively
obscure. These are not read by the people at large.
Allow the agitators a great political centre, like that
of Washington&mdash;<em>permit</em> them to address their voice
of fanatical violence to the whole American people,
through their diffusive press, and they want no greater
advantage. They have a <span class="smcapuc">MORAL LEVER BY WHICH
THEY CAN MOVE A WORLD OF OPINION</span>.</p>

<p>The course of the southern States is therefore
marked out by a pencil of light. They should obtain
additional guarantees against <em>the discussion of slavery
in Congress, in any manner, or in any of its forms,
as it exists in the United States</em>. This is the only
means that promises success in removing agitation.
We have said that this is the accepted time. When
we look at the spread of opinion on this subject in
some of the eastern States&mdash;in Vermont, Massachusetts
and Connecticut&mdash;what are we to expect in a
few years, in the middle States, should discussion
proceed in Congress? These States are yet uninfected,
in any considerable degree, by the fanatical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
spirit. <em>They may not remain so after a lapse of five
years.</em> If they are animated by a true spirit of patriotism&mdash;by
a genuine love for the Union, they should,
and could with effect, interpose to stay this <em>moral</em>
pestilence. Their voice in this matter would be influential.
New York and Pennsylvania are intermediate
between the South and East in position and
in physical strength.’</p>

</div>

<p>Samuel L. Gould, a minister of the Baptist denomination,
writing to the Secretary of the American
Anti-Slavery Society, from Fayette County, Pennsylvania,
in 4th month, 1836, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The Smithfield Anti-Slavery Society, [on the
border of Virginia] has among its members, several
residents of Virginia. Its President has been a slaveholder,
and until recently, was a distinguished citizen
of Virginia, the High Sheriff of Rockingham County.
Having become convinced of the wickedness of slaveholding,
a little more than a year ago he purchased
an estate in Pennsylvania, and removed to it, his
colored men accompanying him. He now employs
them as hired laborers.’</p>

</div>

<p>I may mention, in this connection, an Alabama
slaveholder, a lawyer named Smith, who emancipated
his slaves, I think about twenty in number, a few
months since. He was the brother-in-law of William
Allan of Huntsville, who was in 1834, president of
the Lane Seminary Anti-Slavery Society, and subsequently
an agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society,
and who had for years previous been in kind
and faithful correspondence with him on the subject
of slavery.</p>

<p>Henry P. Thompson, a student of Lane Seminary,
and a slaveholder at the time of the Anti-Slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
discussion in that Institution, was convinced by it,
went to Kentucky, and emancipated his slaves.</p>

<p>Arthur Thome, an elder in the Presbyterian
Church, Augusta, Kentucky, emancipated his slaves,
fourteen in number, about two years since. J. G.
Birney, speaking of him in the Philanthropist, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘For a long time he had been a professor of religion,
but had not, till the doctrines of abolition were
embraced by his son on the discussion of the subject
at Lane Seminary, given to the subject more attention
than was usual among slaveholding professors at the
time. At first he thought his son was deranged&mdash;and
that his intended trip to New York, to speak at
the anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society,
was evidence of it. He sought him (as we have
heard,) on the steamboat, which was to convey him
up the Ohio river, that he might stop him from going.
Something, however, prevented his seeing his son
before his departure, and there was no detention.</p>

<p>The truth bore on the mind of Mr. T. till it produced
its proper fruit&mdash;and he now says, that he is
confident no other doctrine but that of the <span class="smcapuc">SIN</span> of slaveholding,
connected with an <em>immediate</em> breaking off
from it, will influence the slaveholder to do justice.’</p>

</div>

<p>I see by the late Washington papers, that one of
my South Carolina cousins, Robert Barnwell Rhett,
the late Attorney General of the State, has come up
to my help on this point, with his characteristic chivalry;
[howbeit ‘he meaneth not so, neither doth his
heart think so.’] In his late address to his Congressional
Constituents, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Who that knows anything of human affairs, but
must be sensible that the subject of abolition may be
approached in a thousand ways, without direct legislation?
By perpetual discussion, agitation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
threats, accompanied with the real or imaginary
power to perform, <em>there will be need of no other action
than words to shake the confidence of men in the safety
and continuance of the institution of slavery, and its
value and existence will be destroyed</em>. These are all
the weapons the abolitionist desires to be allowed to
use to accomplish his purpose. When Congress
moves, it will be the last act in the drama; and it will
be prepared to enforce its legislation. To acknowledge
the right, or to tolerate the act of interference at
all with this institution, is to give it up&mdash;to abandon
it entirely; and, as this must be the consummation
of any interference, the sooner it is reached the better.
The South must hold this institution, not amidst
alarm and molestation, but in peace&mdash;perfect peace,
from the interference or agitation of others; or, I repeat
it, she <em>will</em>&mdash;she <em>can</em>&mdash;hold it not at all. …
There is no one so weak, but he must perceive that,
whilst the spirit of abolition in the North is increasing,
slavery in the South, in all the frontier States, is decreasing.’</p>

</div>

<p>Farther, I may add the names of J. G. Birney of
Alabama, John Thompson and a person named Meux,
Jassamine County, Kentucky, J. M. Buchanan, Professor
in Center College, Kentucky, Andrew Shannon,
a Presbyterian minister in Shelbyville, Kentucky,
Samuel Taylor, a Presbyterian minister of Nicholasville,
Kentucky, Peter Dunn of Mercer County, Kentucky,
a person named Doake in Tennessee, another
named Carr in North Carolina, another named Harndon
in Virginia&mdash;with a number of others, the particulars
of whose cases I have not now by me, all of
whom were slaveholders four years since, and were
induced to emancipate their slaves through the influence
of Anti-Slavery discussions and periodicals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The Democrat, a political paper published at
Rochester, New York, contained the following in the
summer of 1835.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘On Saturday last, many of our citizens had an
opportunity of witnessing a noble scene. On board
the boat William Henry, then lying at the Exchange
street wharf, were <span class="smcapuc">TEN SLAVES</span>, or those who had recently
been such, and several free persons of color.
The master, a gentleman of more than seventy years
of age, accompanied them. His residence was in
Powhattan County, seventy miles below Richmond,
Virginia. He was on his way to Buffalo, near which
place he intends purchasing a large farm, where his
‘people,’ as he calls them, are to be settled. The
above named gentleman was led to sacrifice much of
this world’s lucre, besides some $5000 of <em>human
‘property,’</em> by becoming convinced of the sinfulness
of his practice while reading <em>Anti-Slavery publications</em>.’</p>

</div>

<p>A letter now lies before me from an elder of a religious
denomination in the far South-West, who
was converted to Abolition sentiments by Anti-Slavery
publications sent to him from the city of New York,
and who has already emancipated his slaves, ten in
number. The writer says, ‘my hopes are revived
when I read of the progress of the cause in the Eastern
States, and of the increase of Anti-Slavery Societies.
My soul glows with gratitude to God for his
mercy to the down-trodden slaves, in raising up for
them in these days of savage cruelty, hundreds who,
fearless of consequences, are standing up for the entire
abolition of slavery, whom, though unseen, I dearly
love. O! how it would delight me to listen to the
public addresses of some of these dear friends.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Hear, too, the reason assigned by James Smylie, a
Presbyterian minister of the Amite Presbytery, Mississippi,
for writing a book in 1836, to prove that slavery
is a divine institution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘From his intercourse with religious societies of
<em>all</em> denominations in Mississippi and Louisiana, he
was aware that the Abolition maxim, viz: that <em>Slavery
is in itself sinful, had gained on and entwined
itself among the religious and conscientious scruples
of many</em> in the community, so far as to render them
<em>unhappy</em>. The eye of the mind, resting on Slavery
itself as a <em>corrupt fountain</em>, from which, of necessity,
<em>nothing but corrupt</em> streams could flow, was <em>incessantly</em>
employed in search of some plan by which,
with safety, the fountain could, in some future time,
be <em>entirely</em> dried up.’ An illustration of this important
acknowledgement, will be found in the following
fact, extracted from the Herald of Freedom: ‘A
young gentleman who has been residing in South
Carolina, says our movements (Abolitionists) are producing
the best effects upon the South, <em>rousing the
consciences of Slaveholders</em>, while the slaves seem to
be impressed as a body with the idea, that help is
coming&mdash;that an interest is felt for them, and plans
devising for their relief somewhere&mdash;which keeps
them quiet. He says it is not uncommon for ministers
and good people to make confession like this.
One, riding with him, broke forth, ‘O, I fear that the
groans and wails from our slaves enter into the ear
of the Lord of Sabaoth. I am distressed on this subject:
my <em>conscience</em> will let me have no peace. I go
to bed, but not to sleep. I walk my room in agony,
and resolve that I will never hold slaves another day;
but in the morning, my heart, like Pharaoh’s, is
hardened.’</p>

</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1835, an influential minister in
one of the most southern States, (who only one year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
before had stoutly defended slavery, and vehemently
insisted that northern abolitionists were producing
unmixed and irremediable evil at the South,) wrote to
the Corresponding Secretary of one of our State Anti-Slavery
Societies who had furnished him with Anti-Slavery
publications, avowing his conversion to Abolition
sentiments, and praying that Anti-Slavery Societies
might persevere in their efforts, and increase
them. Among other expressions of strong feeling
the letter contained the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I am greatly surprised that I should in any form
have been the apologist of a system so full of deadly
poison to all holiness and benevolence as slavery, the
concocted essence of fraud, selfishness, and cold-hearted
tyranny, and the fruitful parent of unnumbered evils,
both to the oppressor and the oppressed,
<span class="smcapuc">THE ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN
BROUGHT TO LIGHT</span>.</p>

<p>‘Do you ask why this change, after residing in a
slave country for twenty years? You remember the
lines of Pope, beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Vice is a monster, of so frightful mien</div>
<div class="verse">As to be hated, needs but to be seen,</div>
<div class="verse">But seen too oft, <em>familiar</em> with her face;</div>
<div class="verse">We first endure, then pity, then <em>embrace</em>.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘I had become so familiar with the loathsome features
of slavery, that they <em>ceased to offend</em>&mdash;besides,
I had become a <em>southern man</em> in all my feelings, and
it is a part of our <em>creed</em> to defend slavery.’</p>

</div>

<p>About two years since, Arthur and Lewis Tappan
received a letter from a Virginian slaveholder, who
held nearly one hundred slaves, and whose conscience
had been greatly roused to the sin of slavery. In the
letter, he avowed his determination to absolve himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
from the guilt of slaveholding, declaring that he ‘had
rather be a wood cutter or a coal heaver, than to <em>remain
in the midst of slavery</em>.’</p>

<p>An intelligent gentleman, a lawyer and a citizen
of the District of Columbia, has just written a letter
to a gentleman of New York city, from which I give
thee the following extract:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The proceedings in Congress at this session have
had the effect, I think, to rouse the attention of the
public in all quarters, to the subject of slavery; and
that, of itself, I think is a good: and it is in my
opinion the chief present good that is to grow out of
it. Discussion of some sort takes place, and the real
foundation on which the system rests, cannot but be
brought more or less into view. My hope is, that
men who <em>denounce</em> now, will at length <em>reason</em>. That
is what is wanted&mdash;reasoning, reflection, and a true
perception of the basis on which slavery is founded.’</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing are but a few of the facts and testimonies
in the possession of Abolitionists, showing
that their discussions, periodicals, petitions, arguments,
appeals and societies, have extensively moved, and
are still mightily moving the slaveholding States&mdash;<em>for
good</em>. Did time and space permit, I might, by a little
painstaking, procure many more. Before passing
from this part of the subject, I must record my
amazement at the clamors of many of the opponents
of Abolitionists, from whom better things might indeed
be hoped. What slaveholders have you convinced?
they demand. Whom have you made Abolitionists?
Give us their names and places of abode. Now, those
who incessantly stun us with such unreasonable
clamor, know full well, that to give the public the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
names and residences of such persons, would be in
most instances to surrender them to butchery. But
be it known to the North and to the South, we have
names of scores of citizens of the slaveholding states,
many of them slaveholders, who are in constant correspondence
with us, persons who feel so deeply on
the subject as to implore us to persevere in our efforts,
and not to be dismayed by Southern threats nor
disheartened by Northern cavils and heartlessness. Yea
more, these persons have committed to us the custody
even of their lives, thus encountering imminent peril
that they might cheer us onward in our work.
Shall we betray their trust, or put them in jeopardy?
Judge thou.</p>

<p>Now let me ask, when in former years Anti-Slavery
tracts, with our doctrines, could be circulated at
the South? The fact is, there were <em>none</em> to be circulated
there; our principle of repentance is quite
new. But I can tell thee of two facts, which it is
probable thou ‘hast not been informed of.’ In the
year 1809, the steward of a vessel, a colored man,
carried some Abolition pamphlets to Charleston.
Immediately on his arrival, he was informed against,
and would have been tried for his life, had he not
promised to leave the State, never to return. Was
South Carolina willing to receive abolition pamphlets
<em>then</em>? Again, in 1820, my sister carried some pamphlets
there&mdash;‘Thoughts on Slavery,’ issued by the
Society of Friends, and therefore <em>not</em> very incendiary,
thou mayest be assured; and yet she was informed
some time afterwards, that had it not been for the
influence of our family, she would have been imprisoned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
for she, too, was accused of giving one of
them to a slave; just as Abolitionists have been
falsely charged with sending their papers to the enslaved.
What she did give away, she was <em>obliged</em>
to give <em>privately</em>. Was Charleston ready to receive
Abolition pamphlets <em>then</em>? Or when? please to tell
me. I say that <em>more</em>, far more Anti-Slavery tracts,
&amp;c. are <em>now</em> read in the South, than ever were at
any former period. As to Colonization tracts, I
know they have circulated at the South; but what
of that, when Southerners believed that Colonization
had <em>no</em> connection with the overthrow of Slavery?
Colonization papers, &amp;c. are not Abolition papers.</p>

<p>As to preachers, let me assure thee, that they <em>never</em>
have dared to preach on the subject of slavery in
my native city, so far as my knowledge extends.
Ah! I for some years sat under two <em>northern</em> ministers,
but never did I hear them preach in public, or
speak in private, on the <em>sin</em> of slavery. O! the <em>deep</em>,
<span class="smcapuc">DEEP</span> injury which such unfaithful ministers have inflicted
on the South! It is well known that our
young men have, to a great extent, been educated in
Northern Theological Seminaries. With what principles
were <em>their</em> minds imbued? What kind of
religion did the <em>North</em> prepare them to preach? A
slaveholding religion. What kind of religion did
<em>northern men</em> come down and preach to us? A
slaveholding religion&mdash;and multitudes of them became
slaveholders. Such was one of my <em>northern</em>
pastors. And yet thou tellest me, the North has
nothing to do with slavery at the South&mdash;is <em>not</em> guilty,
&amp;c. &amp;c. ‘Their own clergy,’ thou sayest, ‘either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
entirely hold their peace, or become the defenders
of a system they once lamented, and attempted
to bring to an end.’ Do name to me one of those
valiant defenders of slavery, who formerly lamented
over the system, and attempted to bring it to an end.
‘What is his name, or what is his son’s name, if
thou canst tell?’ Strange indeed, if, because <em>we</em> advocate
the truth, others should begin to hate it; or
because we expose sin, they should turn round and
defend what once they lamented over! Is this in
accordance with ‘the known laws of mind,’ where
principle is deeply rooted in the heart?</p>

<p>And then thou closest these assertions <em>without
proof</em>, with the triumphant exclamation, ‘This is
the record of experience, as to the tendencies of abolitionism,
as thus far developed. The South is just
now in that state of high exasperation, at the sense
of wanton injury and <em>impertinent interference</em>, which
makes the influence of truth and reason most useless
and powerless.’ Hadst thou been better informed as
to the real tendencies of abolitionism on the South,
this assertion also might have been spared. Again
I repeat, the <em>South</em> does not tell us so. Read the
subjoined extract of a letter now lying before me
from a correspondent in a <em>Southern</em> State. ‘12 or 15
at this place believe that <em>all</em> men are born free and
equal, that <em>prejudice against color is a disgrace to the
man who feels it</em>, that such a feeling is without foundation
in reason or scripture, and ought to be abandoned
<em>immediately</em>, that slavery is a <em>malum in se</em>, yea,
a <em>heinous crime</em> in the sight of God, to be repented
of <em>without delay</em>.’ Read also the following, extracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from the Marietta Gazette: ‘A citizen of one of
the free states, not many months ago, observed to
a distinguished southerner, that the operations of the
abolitionists were impeding the cause of emancipation&mdash;or
to that effect. ‘Sir,’ said the Southerner,
‘You are mistaken. Depend upon it, these agitations
have put the slaveholders to very serious thinking.’
These, then, are the effects which Abolitionism is
producing on some at the South. That others are
exasperated, I do not deny. Hear what Bolling of
Virginia said in 1832, in the Legislature of that
State: ‘It has long been the pleasure of those
who are wedded to the system of slavery, to brand
<em>all</em> its opponents with opprobrious epithets; to represent
them as enemies to order, as persons desirous
of tearing up the foundation of society thereby
endeavoring to brand them with infamy in
order to avert from them the public ear.’ Here then
we find a Southern Legislator acknowledging that
<em>all</em> the opponents of Slavery have ever excited the
same exasperation in those who are ‘wedded to the
system.’ Who is to be blamed? Is <em>this</em> any cause
of discouragement? That we have succeeded in
rousing the North to reflection, thou art thyself a living
proof; for let me ask, what it was that set <em>thee</em> to
such serious thinking, as to induce <em>thee</em> to write a
<em>book</em> on the Slave Question?</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_X">LETTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">‘THE TENDENCY OF THE AGE TOWARDS EMANCIPATION’
PRODUCED BY ABOLITION DOCTRINES.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: Thou sayest, ‘that this evil (Slavery,)
is at no distant period to come to an end, is the
unanimous opinion of all who either notice the tendencies
of the age, or believe in the prophecies of the
Bible.’ But how can this be true, if Abolitionists
have indeed rolled back the car of Emancipation? If
our measures really tend to this result, how can this
evil come to an end at no distant period? Colonizationists
tell us, if it had not been for our interference,
they could have done a vast deal better than they have
done; and the American Unionists say, that we have
paralyzed their efforts, so that they can do nothing;
and yet ‘the tendencies of the age’ are crowding forward
Emancipation. Now, what has produced this
tendency? Surely every reflecting person must acknowledge,
that Colonization cannot effect the work
of Abolition. The American Union is doing nothing;
and Abolitionists are pursuing a course which ‘will
tend to bring slavery to an end, <em>if at all</em>, at the <em>most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
distant</em> period,’&mdash;then do tell me, how the tendencies
of the age can possibly lean towards Emancipation!
Perhaps I shall be told, that the movements of Great
Britain in the West Indies created this tendency.
Ah! but this is a <em>foreign influence</em>, more so even than
Northern influence; and if the North is ‘a foreign
community,’ as thou expressly stylest it, and can on
<em>that account</em> produce <em>no</em> influence on the South, how
can the doings of England affect her?</p>

<p>Now I believe with thee, that the tendencies of the
age are toward Emancipation; but I contend that nothing
but free discussion has produced this tendency&mdash;‘the
present agitation of the subject’ is in fact <em>the
thing</em> which is producing this happy tendency. Now
let us turn to the South, and ask her eagle-eyed politicians
what <em>they</em> are most afraid of. Read their answer
in their desperate struggles to fetter the press
and gag the mouths of&mdash;<em>whom?</em>&mdash;Colonizationists?
Why no&mdash;<em>they</em> talk colonization <em>themselves</em>, and are
not at all afraid that the expatriation of a few hundreds
or thousands in 20 years will ever drain the
country of its millions of slaves, where they are now
increasing at the rate of 70,000 every year. The
American Unionists? O no! the South has not
deemed them worthy of any notice! Pray, then,
<em>whose</em> mouths are slaveholders so fiercely striving to
seal in silence? Why, the mouths of Abolitionists, to
be sure&mdash;even our infant school children know this.
Strange indeed, when the labors of these men are actually
rolling back the car of Emancipation for one or
two centuries! Why, the South ought to pour out
her treasure, to support Anti-Slavery agents, and print<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Anti-Slavery papers and pamphlets, and do all she
can to aid us in <em>rolling back</em> Emancipation. Pray,
write <em>her a book</em>, and tell her she has been very needlessly
alarmed at our doings, and advise her to send
us a few thousand dollars: her money would be very
acceptable in these hard times, and we would take
it as the wages due to the unpaid laborers, though we
would never admit the donors to membership with us.
How dost thou think <em>she</em> would receive <em>such a book</em>?
Just try it, I entreat thee.</p>

<p>Thou seemest to think that the North has <em>no right</em>
to rebuke the South, and assumest the ground that
Abolitionists are the enemies of the South. We say,
we have the right, and mean to exercise it. I believe
that every northern Legislature has a right, and ought
to use the right, to send a solemn remonstrance to
every southern Legislature on the subject of slavery.
Just as much right as the South has to send up a remonstrance
against our free presses, free pens, and
free tongues. Let the North follow her example; but,
instead of asking her to enslave her subjects, entreat
her to <em>free</em> them. The South may pretend <em>now</em>, that
we have no right to interfere, because it suits her convenience
to say so; but a few years ago, (1820,) we
find that our Vice President, R. M. Johnson, in his
speech on the Missouri question, was amazed at the
‘cold insensibility, the eternal apathy towards the
slaves in the District of Columbia,’ which was exhibited
by <em>northern</em> men, ‘though they had occular demonstration
continually’ before them of the abominations
of slavery. <em>Then</em> the South wondered <em>we did
not interfere with slavery</em>&mdash;and <em>now</em> she says we have
no right to interfere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>I find, on the 57th p. a false assertion with regard
to Abolitionists. After showing the folly of our rejecting
the worldly doctrine of expediency, so excellent
in thy view, thou then sayest that we say, the
reason why we do not go to the South is, that we
should be murdered. Now, if there are any half-hearted
Abolitionists, who are thus recreant to the
high and holy principle of ‘Duty is ours, and events
are God’s,’ then I must leave such to explain their
own inconsistencies; but that this is the reason assigned
by the Society, as a body, I never have seen nor
believed. So far from it, that I have invariably heard
those who understood the principles of the Anti-Slavery
Society best, <em>deny</em> that it was a duty to go to the
South, <em>not</em> because they would be killed, but because
the <em>North was guilty</em>, and therefore ought to be labored
with <em>first</em>. They took exactly the same view of
the subject, which was taken by the southern friend
of mine to whom I have already alluded. ‘Until
northern women, (said she,) do their duty on the
subject of slavery, <em>southern</em> women cannot be expected
to do theirs.’ I therefore utterly deny this charge.
Such may be the opinion of a few, but it is not and
cannot be proved to be a principle of action in the
Anti-Slavery Society. The fact is, we need no excuse
for not going to the South, so long as the North
is as deeply involved in the guilt of slavery as she is,
and as blind to her duty.</p>

<p>One word with regard to these remarks: ‘Before
the Abolition movements commenced, both northern
and southern men expressed their views freely at the
South.’ This, also, I deny, because, as a southerner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
<em>I know</em> that <em>I</em> never could express my views freely on
the abominations of slavery, without exciting anger,
even in professors of religion. It is true, ‘the <em>dangers</em>,
<em>evils</em> and <em>mischiefs</em> of slavery’ could be, and were
discussed at the South and the North. Yes, we
might talk as much as we pleased about <em>these</em>, as long
as we viewed slavery as a <em>misfortune</em> to the <em>slaveholder</em>,
and talked of ‘the dangers, evils and mischiefs
of slavery’ to <em>him</em>, and pitied <em>him</em> for having had
such a ‘sad inheritance entailed upon him.’ But
could any man or woman ever ‘express their views
freely’ on the <span class="smcapuc">SIN</span> of slavery at the South? I say,
never! Could they express their views freely as to
the dangers, mischiefs and evils of slavery to the <em>poor
suffering slave</em>? No, never! It was only whilst the
<em>slaveholder</em> was regarded as <em>an unfortunate sufferer</em>,
and sympathized with <em>as such</em>, that he was willing to
talk, and be talked to, on this ‘delicate subject.’
Hence we find, that as soon as <em>he</em> is addressed as a
<em>guilty oppressor</em>, why then he is in a phrenzy of passion.
As soon as we set before him the dangers, and
evils, and mischiefs of slavery to <em>the down-trodden
victims of his oppression</em>, O then! the slaveholder
storms and raves like a maniac. Now look at this
view of the subject: as a southerner, I know it is the
only correct one.</p>

<p>With regard to the discussion of ‘the subject of
slavery, in the legislative halls of the South,’ if thou
hast read these debates, thou certainly must know
that they did not touch on the <span class="smcapuc">SIN</span> of slavery at all;
they were wholly confined to ‘the dangers, evils and
mischiefs of slavery’ to the <em>unfortunate slaveholder</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
What did the discussion in the Virginia legislature
result in? In the <em>rejection of every</em> plan of emancipation,
and in the passage of an act which they believed
would give additional permanency to the institution,
whilst it divested it of its dangers, by removing
the free people of color to Liberia; for which purpose
they voted $20,000, but took very good care to provide,
‘that no slave to be thereafter emancipated should
have the benefit of the appropriation,’ so fearful were
they, lest masters might avail themselves of this
scheme of expatriation to manumit their slaves. The
Maryland scheme is altogether based on the principle
of banishment and oppression. The colored people
were to be ‘got rid of,’ for the benefit of their lordly
oppressors&mdash;<em>not</em> set free from the noble principles of
justice and mercy to <em>them</em>. If Abolitionists have put
a stop to all <em>such</em> discussions of slavery, I, for one, do
most heartily rejoice at it. The fact is, the South is
enraged, because we have exposed her horrible hypocrisy
to the world. We have torn off the mask,
and brought to light the hidden things of darkness.</p>

<p>To prove to thee that the South, as a body, never
was prepared for emancipation, I might detail historical
facts, which are stubborn things; but I have not
the time to go into this subject that would be necessary.
I will, therefore, give a few extracts from documents
published by the old Abolition Societies, whose principle
was gradualism. In 1803, in the report of the
Delaware Society, I find the following statement:&mdash;‘The
general temper and opinion of the opulent in
this state, is either <em>opposed</em> to the generous principles
of emancipation to the people of color, or indifferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to the success of the work.’ In 1804, when a Committee
was appointed to draft a memorial to the Legislature
of North Carolina, we find the following
sentiment expressed in their Report:&mdash;‘They believe
that public opinion in that state is <em>exceedingly hostile
to the abolition of slavery</em>; and <em>every</em> attempt towards
emancipation is regarded with an indignant and jealous
eye; that at present, the inhabitants of that State
consider the preservation of their lives, and all they
hold dear on earth, as depending on the continuance
of slavery, and are even riveting <em>more firmly</em> the fetters
of oppression.’ ‘They believe that great difficulty
would attend the presentation of an address to the
public, and that, if presented, it would not be read.’
The address was, however, issued, and in it we find
this complaint&mdash;‘Many <em>aspersions</em> have been cast upon
the advocates of the freedom of the blacks, by malicious
and interested men.’ In 1805, in the Report of
the Alexandria Society, District of Columbia, they
say&mdash;‘There is rather a disposition to <em>increase</em> the
measure of affliction already appointed to the poor deserted
African:’ and complain of the decline of the
Society, for which they assign several reasons, one of
which is, ‘the admission of slaveholders into fellowship
at its formation.’ Several of the Reports state,
that they fully learned the impolicy of <em>this</em> measure,
by the violent opposition which these slaveholding
members made to their efforts for emancipation. Just
as well might a Temperance Society admit a practical
drunkard into their ranks, as for an Abolition Society
to admit a slaveholder to membership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1806, the Report of the Pennsylvania Society
says&mdash;‘We believe the true reason, why ostensible
and public measures are not pursued by the advocates
of abolition in the southern states, will be found in the
pretty general impression, that it would not, <em>under existing
circumstances</em>, and in the <em>present temper of the
public mind</em>, be expedient and useful.’ The Wilmington
Report ‘laments that the people of South
Carolina <em>continue opposed</em> to our cause’&mdash;and in 1809,
the Report of this same Society says, ‘We regret most
sincerely the difficulty we labor under in establishing
corresponding agents in the southern states, on whose
fidelity and integrity we can firmly rely.’ In 1816,
the Delaware Society makes the following confession&mdash;‘When
we look back at the bright prospects
which opened on this cause within the last 20 years,
and recur to the joyful feelings excited by the just
anticipations of speedy success in this conflict with
cruelty and wrong, we cannot but feel the pressure of
that gloom which is the consequence of <em>disappointment
and defeat</em>.’ In 1826, we find the North Carolina
Report acknowledging that ‘the <em>gentlest</em> attempt
to agitate the subject, or the <em>slightest hint</em> at the work
of emancipation, is sufficient to call forth their <em>indignant
resentment</em>, as if their dearest rights were invaded.’</p>

<p>How, then, can our opponents say, that the cause
of emancipation has been <em>rolled back</em> by <em>us</em>? We
ask, when was it ever <em>forward</em>? As a southerner, I
repeat my solemn conviction, from <em>my own experience</em>,
and from all I can learn from historical facts, and the
reports of the Gradual Emancipation Societies of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
country, and the scope of the debates which took place
in the Kentucky, Virginia and Maryland Legislatures,
that it <em>never was</em> forward. If the tendencies of the
age are towards emancipation, they are tendencies
peculiar to this age in the United States, and have
been brought about by free discussion, and in accordance,
too, with the <em>known laws of mind</em>; for collision
of mind as naturally produces light, as the striking of
the flint and the steel produces fire. <em>Free discussion
is this collision</em>, and the results are visible in the light
which is breaking forth in every city, town and village,
and spreading over the hills and valleys, through
the whole length and breadth of our land. Yes! it
has already reached ‘the dark valley of the shadow
of death’ in the South; and in a few brief years, He
who said, ‘Let there be light,’ will gather this moral
effulgence into a focal point, and beneath its burning
rays, the heart of the slaveholder, and the chains of
the slave, will melt like wax before the orb of day.</p>

<p>Let us, then, take heed lest we be found fighting
against God while standing idle in the market place,
or endeavoring to keep other laborers out of the field
now already white to the harvest.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XI">LETTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SPHERE OF WOMAN AND MAN AS MORAL BEINGS
THE SAME.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Brookline</span>, Mass., <i>8th month, 28th, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: I come now to that part of thy
book, which is, of all others, the most important to the
women of this country; thy ‘general views in relation
to the place woman is appointed to fill by the
dispensations of heaven.’ I shall quote paragraphs
from thy book, offer my objections to them, and then
throw before thee my own views.</p>

<p>Thou sayest, ‘Heaven has appointed to one sex
the <em>superior</em>, and to the other the <em>subordinate</em> station,
and this without any reference to the character or conduct
of either.’ This is an assertion without proof.
Thou further sayest, that ‘it was designed that the
mode of gaining influence and exercising power
should be <em>altogether different and peculiar</em>.’ Does
the Bible teach this? ‘Peace on earth, and good
will to men, is the character of all the rights and
privileges, the influence and the power of <em>woman</em>.’
Indeed! Did our Holy Redeemer preach the doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of <em>peace to our sex</em> only? ‘A <em>man</em> may act on
Society by the collision of intellect, in public debate;
<em>he</em> may urge his measures by a sense of shame, by
fear and by personal interest; <em>he</em> may coerce by the
combination of public sentiment; <em>he</em> may drive by
physical force, and <em>he</em> does <em>not</em> overstep the boundaries
of his sphere.’ Did Jesus, then, give a different
rule of action to men and women? Did he tell his
disciples, when he sent them out to preach the gospel,
that man might appeal to the fear, and shame,
and interest of those he addressed, and coerce by public
sentiment, and drive by physical force? ‘But
(that) all the power and all the conquests that are
lawful to <em>woman</em> are those only which appeal to the
kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles?’
If so, I should come to a very different conclusion
from the one at which thou hast arrived: I should
suppose that <em>woman was the superior</em>, and <em>man the
subordinate being</em>, inasmuch as moral power is immeasurably
superior to ‘physical force.’</p>

<p>‘Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making <em>herself</em> so much respected, &amp;c. that to
yield to <em>her</em> opinions, and to gratify <em>her</em> wishes, will
be the free-will offering of the heart.’ This principle
may do as the rule of action to the fashionable belle,
whose idol is <em>herself</em>; whose every attitude and
smile are designed to win the admiration of others to
<em>herself</em>; and who enjoys, with exquisite delight, the
double-refined incense of flattery which is offered to
<em>her</em> vanity, by yielding to <em>her</em> opinions, and gratifying
<em>her</em> wishes, because they are <em>hers</em>. But to the humble
Christian, who feels that it is <em>truth</em> which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
seeks to recommend to others, <em>truth</em> which she wants
them to esteem and love, and not herself, this subtle
principle must be rejected with holy indignation.
Suppose she could win thousands to her opinions,
and govern them by her wishes, how much nearer
would they be to Jesus Christ, if she presents no
higher motive, and points to no higher leader?</p>

<p>‘But this is all to be accomplished in the domestic
circle.’ Indeed! ‘Who made thee a ruler and a
judge over all?’ I read in the Bible, that Miriam,
and Deborah, and Huldah, were called to fill <em>public
stations</em> in Church and State. I find Anna, the
prophetess, speaking in the temple ‘unto all them
that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.’ During
his ministry on earth, I see women following him
from town to town, in the most public manner; I
hear the woman of Samaria, on her return to the
city, telling the <em>men</em> to come and see a man who had
told her all things that ever she did. I see them
even standing on Mount Calvary, around his cross,
in the most exposed situation; but He never <em>rebuked</em>
them; He never told them it was unbecoming <em>their
sphere in life</em> to mingle in the crowds which followed
his footsteps. Then, again, I see the cloven tongues
of fire resting on each of the heads of the one hundred
and twenty disciples, some of whom were
<em>women</em>; yea, I hear <em>them preaching</em> on the day of
Pentecost to the multitudes who witnessed the outpouring
of the spirit on that glorious occasion; for,
unless <em>women</em> as well as men received the Holy
Ghost, and <em>prophesied</em>, what did Peter mean by telling
them, ‘This is <em>that</em> which was spoken by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
prophet Joel: And it shall come to pass in the last
days, said <em>God</em>, I will pour out my spirit upon <em>all</em>
flesh: and your sons and your <em>daughters shall prophesy</em>. …
And on my servants and on my <em>handmaidens</em>,
I will pour out in those days of my spirit; and
<em>they shall prophesy</em>.’ This is the plain matter of fact,
as Clark and Scott, Stratton and Locke, all allow.
Mine is no ‘private interpretation,’ no mere sectarian
view.</p>

<p>I find, too, that Philip had four daughters which
did <em>prophesy</em>; and what is still more convincing, I
read in the xi. of I. Corinthians, some particular directions
from the Apostle Paul, as to <em>how</em> women
were to pray and prophesy in the assemblies of the
people&mdash;<em>not</em> in the domestic circle. On examination,
too, it appears that the very same word, <i>Diakonos</i>,
which, when applied to Phœbe, Romans xvi. 1, is
translated <i>servant</i>, when applied to Tychicus, Ephesians
vi. 21, is rendered <i>minister</i>. Ecclesiastical
History informs us, that this same Phœbe was pre-eminently
useful, as a minister in the Church, and
that female ministers suffered martyrdom in the first
ages of Christianity. And what, I ask, does the
Apostle mean when he says in Phillipians iv. 3.&mdash;‘Help
those women who labored with me in the gospel’?
Did these holy women of old perform all
their gospel labors in ‘the domestic and social circle’?
I trow not.</p>

<p>Thou sayest, ‘the moment woman begins to feel
the promptings of ambition, or the thirst for power,
her ægis of defence is gone.’ Can man, then, retain
his ægis when he indulges these guilty passions? Is
it woman only who suffers this loss?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>‘All the generous promptings of chivalry, all the
poetry of romantic gallantry, depend upon woman’s
retaining her place as <em>dependent</em> and <em>defenceless</em>, and
making no claims, and maintaining no rights, but
what are the gifts of honor, rectitude and love.’</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from pronouncing this sentiment
as beneath the dignity of any woman who names the
name of Christ. No woman, who understands her
dignity as a moral, intellectual, and accountable being,
cares aught for any attention or any protection,
vouchsafed by ‘the promptings of chivalry, and the
poetry of romantic gallantry’? Such a one loathes
such littleness, and turns with disgust from all such
silly insipidities. Her noble nature is insulted by
such paltry, sickening adulation, and she will not
stoop to drink the foul waters of so turbid a stream.
If all this sinful foolery is to be withdrawn from our
sex, with all my heart I say, <em>the sooner the better</em>.
Yea, I say more, no woman who lives up to the true
glory of her womanhood, will ever be treated with
such <em>practical contempt</em>. Every man, when in the
presence of true moral greatness, ‘will find an influence
thrown around him,’ which will utterly forbid
the exercise of ‘the poetry of romantic gallantry.’</p>

<p>What dost thou mean by woman’s retaining her
place as defenceless and dependent? Did our Heavenly
Father furnish man with any offensive or defensive
weapons? Was <em>he</em> created any less defenceless
than <em>she</em> was? Are they not equally defenceless,
equally dependent on Him? What did Jesus
say to his disciples, when he commissioned them to
preach the gospel?&mdash;‘Behold, I send you forth as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
<span class="smcapuc">SHEEP</span> in the midst of wolves; be ye wise as serpents,
and <em>harmless</em> as <em>doves</em>. What more could he
have said to women?</p>

<p>Again, she must ‘make no claims, and maintain no
rights, but what are the gifts of honor, rectitude and
love.’ From whom does woman receive her <em>rights</em>?
From God, or from man? What dost thou mean by
saying, her rights are the <em>gifts</em> of honor, rectitude
and love? One would really suppose that man, as
her lord and master, was the gracious giver of her
rights, and that these rights were bestowed upon her
by ‘the promptings of chivalry, and the poetry of romantic
gallantry,’&mdash;out of the abundance of his honor,
rectitude and love. Now, if I understand the real
state of the case, woman’s rights are not the gifts of
man&mdash;no! nor the <em>gifts</em> of God. His gifts to her
may be recalled at his good pleasure&mdash;but her <em>rights</em>
are an integral part of her moral being; they cannot
be withdrawn; they must live with her forever. Her
rights lie at the foundation of all her duties; and, so
long as the divine commands are binding upon her,
so long must her rights continue.</p>

<p>‘A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity,’ &amp;c. <em>Appropriate</em>
offices! Ah! here is the great difficulty. What are
they? Who can point them out? Who has ever
attempted to draw a line of separation between the
duties of men and women, as <em>moral</em> beings, without
committing the grossest inconsistencies on the one
hand, or running into the most arrant absurdities on
the other?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into
the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others&mdash;whatever
binds her in a party conflict&mdash;whatever
obliges her in any way to exert coercive influences,
throws her out of her appropriate sphere.’ If, by a
<em>combatant</em>, thou meanest one who ‘drives by <em>physical
force</em>,’ then I say, <em>man</em> has no more right to appear
as <em>such</em> a combatant than woman; for all the
pacific precepts of the gospel were given to <em>him</em>, as
well as to her. If, by a <em>party conflict</em>, thou meanest
a struggle for power, either civil or ecclesiastical,
a thirst for the praise and the honor of man, why,
then I would ask, is this the proper sphere of <em>any</em>
moral, accountable being, man or woman? If, by
<em>coercive influences</em>, thou meanest the use of force or
of fear, such as slaveholders and warriors employ,
then, I repeat, that <em>man</em> has no more right to exert
these than <em>woman</em>. All such influences are repudiated
by the precepts and examples of Christ, and his
apostles; so that, after all, this appropriate sphere of
woman is <em>just as appropriate to man</em>. These ‘general
principles are correct,’ if thou wilt only permit
them to be of <em>general application</em>.</p>

<p>Thou sayest that the propriety of woman’s coming
forward as a suppliant for a portion of her sex who
are bound in cruel bondage, depends entirely on its
<em>probable results</em>. I thought the disciples of Jesus
were to walk by <em>faith</em>, <em>not</em> by sight. Did Abraham
reason as to the <em>probable results</em> of his offering up
Isaac? No! or he could not have raised his hand
against the life of his son; because in Isaac, he had
been told, his seed should be called,&mdash;that seed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed.
O! when shall we learn that God is wiser than man&mdash;that
his ways are higher than our ways, his thoughts
than our thoughts&mdash;and that ‘obedience is better than
sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams?’ If
we are always to <em>reason</em> on the <em>probable results</em> of
performing our duty, I wonder what our Master meant
by telling his disciples, that they must become like
<em>little children</em>. I used to think he designed to inculcate
the necessity of walking by faith, in childlike
simplicity, docility and humility. But if we are to
<em>reason</em> as to the <em>probable results</em> of obeying the injunctions
to plead for the widow and the fatherless,
and to deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor,
&amp;c., then I do not know what he meant to
teach.</p>

<p>According to what thou sayest, the women of this
country are not to be governed by principles of duty,
but by the effect their petitions produce on the members
of Congress, and by the opinions of these men.
If they deem them ‘obtrusive, indecorous, and unwise,’
they must not be sent. If <em>thou</em> canst consent
to exchange the precepts of the Bible for the opinions
of <em>such a body of men</em> as now sit on the destinies
of this nation, I cannot. What is this but
<em>obeying man</em> rather than God, and seeking the <em>praise
of man</em> rather than of God? As to our petitions increasing
the evils of slavery, this is merely an opinion,
the correctness or incorrectness of which remains
to be proved. When I hear Senator Preston of
South Carolina, saying, that ‘he regarded the concerted
movement upon the District of Columbia as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
an attempt to storm the gates of the citadel&mdash;as
throwing the bridge over the moat’&mdash;and declaring
that ‘the South must resist the <em>danger</em> in its inception,
or it would <em>soon become irresistible</em>‘&mdash;I feel confident
that petitions will effect the work of emancipation,
<em>thy</em> opinion to the contrary notwithstanding.
And when I hear Francis W. Pickens, from the
same State, saying in a speech delivered in Congress&mdash;‘Mr.
Speaker, we cannot mistake all these things.
The truth is, the moral power of the world is against
us. It is idle to disguise it. We must, sooner or
later, meet the great issue that is to be made on this
subject. Deeply connected with this, is the movement
to be made on the District of Columbia. If the
power be asserted in Congress to interfere here, or
any approach be made toward that end, <em>it will give a
shock to our institutions</em> and the country, the consequences
of which no man can foretell. Sir, as well
might you grapple with iron grasp into the very
heart and vitals of South Carolina, as to touch this
subject here.’ When I hear these things from the
lips of keen-eyed politicians of the South, northern
apologies for not interfering with the subject of slavery,
‘lest it should increase, rather than diminish the
evils it is wished to remove’ affect me little.</p>

<p>Another objection to woman’s petitions is, that they
may ‘tend to bring females, as petitioners and partisans,
into every political measure that may tend to
injure and oppress their sex.’ As to their ever becoming
partisans, i.e. sacrificing principles to power
or interest, I reprobate this under all circumstances,
and in <em>both</em> sexes. But I trust my sisters may always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
be permitted to <em>petition</em> for a redress of grievances.
Why not? The right of petition is the only
political right that women have: why not let them
exercise it whenever they are aggrieved? Our fathers
waged a bloody conflict with England, because
<em>they</em> were taxed without being represented. This is
just what unmarried women of property now are.
<em>They</em> were not willing to be governed by laws which
<em>they</em> had no voice in making; but this is the way in
which women are governed in this Republic. If,
then, <em>we</em> are taxed without being represented, and
governed by laws <em>we</em> have no voice in framing, then,
surely, we ought to be permitted at least to remonstrate
against ‘every political measure that may tend
to injure and oppress our sex in various parts of the
nation, and under the various public measures that
may hereafter be enforced.’ Why not? Art thou
afraid to trust the women of this country with discretionary
power as to petitioning? Is there not
sound principle and common sense enough among
them, to regulate the exercise of this right? I believe
they will always use it wisely. I am not afraid to
trust my sisters&mdash;not I.</p>

<p>Thou sayest, ‘In this country, petitions to Congress,
in reference to official duties of legislators,
seem, IN ALL CASES, to fall entirely without the
sphere of female duty. Men are the proper persons
to make appeals to the rulers whom they appoint,’
&amp;c. Here I entirely dissent from thee. The fact
that women are denied the right of voting for members
of Congress, is but a poor reason why they
should also be deprived of the right of petition. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
their numbers are counted to swell the number of
Representatives in our State and National Legislatures,
the <em>very least</em> that can be done is to give them
the right of petition in all cases whatsoever; and
without any abridgement. If not, they are mere
slaves, known only through their masters.</p>

<p>In my next, I shall throw out my own views with
regard to ‘the appropriate sphere of woman’&mdash;and
for the present, subscribe myself,</p>

<span class="smaller">HUMAN RIGHTS NOT FOUNDED ON SEX.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">East Boylston</span>, Mass., <i>10th mo. 2d, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: In my last, I made a sort of running
commentary upon thy views of the appropriate
sphere of woman, with something like a promise, that
in my next, I would give thee my own.</p>

<p>The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land&mdash;the school in which <em>human rights</em>
are more fully investigated, and better understood
and taught, than in any other. Here a great fundamental
principle is uplifted and illuminated, and
from this central light, rays innumerable stream all
around. Human beings have <em>rights</em>, because they
are <em>moral</em> beings: the rights of <em>all</em> men grow out of
their moral nature; and as all men have the same
moral nature, they have essentially the same rights.
These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they
cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect
<em>now</em>, as is that of Lyman Beecher: it is stamped on
his moral being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,
then the <em>mere circumstance of sex</em> does not give to
man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.
To suppose that it does, would be to deny the self-evident
truth, that the ‘physical constitution is the
mere instrument of the moral nature.’ To suppose
that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations,
of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting
the animal nature into a monarch, and humbling
the moral into a slave; making the former a
proprietor, and the latter its property. When human
beings are regarded as <em>moral</em> beings, <em>sex</em>, instead
of being enthroned upon the summit, administering
upon rights and responsibilities, sinks into insignificance
and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that
whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is
morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate,
not from difference of sex, but from the diversity
of our relations in life, the various gifts and
talents committed to our care, and the different eras
in which we live.</p>

<p>This regulation of duty by the mere circumstance
of sex, rather than by the fundamental principle of
moral being, has led to all that multifarious train of
evils flowing out of the anti-christian doctrine of masculine
and feminine virtues. By this doctrine, man
has been converted into the warrior, and clothed
with sternness, and those other kindred qualities,
which in common estimation belong to his character
as a <em>man</em>; whilst woman has been taught to lean
upon an arm of flesh, to sit as a doll arrayed in ‘gold,
and pearls, and costly array,’ to be admired for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
personal charms, and caressed and humored like a
spoiled child, or converted into a mere drudge to suit
the convenience of her lord and master. Thus have
all the diversified relations of life been filled with
‘confusion and every evil work.’ This principle
has given to man a charter for the exercise of tyranny
and selfishness, pride and arrogance, lust and brutal
violence. It has robbed woman of essential
rights, the right to think and speak and act on all
great moral questions, just as men think and speak
and act; the right to share their responsibilities, perils
and toils; the right to fulfil the great end of her
being, as a moral, intellectual and immortal creature,
and of glorifying God in her body and her spirit
which are His. Hitherto, instead of being a help
meet to man, in the highest, noblest sense of the
term, as a companion, a co-worker, an equal; she
has been a mere appendage of his being, an instrument
of his convenience and pleasure, the pretty toy
with which he wiled away his leisure moments, or
the pet animal whom he humored into playfulness
and submission. Woman, instead of being regarded
as the equal of man, has uniformly been looked
down upon as his inferior, a mere gift to fill up the
measure of his happiness. In ‘the poetry of romantic
gallantry,’ it is true, she has been called ‘the last
<em>best</em> gift of God to man;’ but I believe I speak forth
the words of truth and soberness when I affirm, that
woman never was given to man. She was created,
like him, in the image of God, and crowned with
glory and honor; created only a little lower than the
angels,&mdash;not, as is almost universally assumed, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
lower than man; on her brow, as well as on his, was
placed the ‘diadem of beauty,’ and in her hand the
sceptre of universal dominion. Gen: i. 27, 28.
‘The last <em>best gift</em> of God to man!’ Where is the
scripture warrant for this ‘rhetorical flourish, this
splendid absurdity?’ Let us examine the account of
her creation. ‘And the rib which the Lord God had
taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her
unto the man.’ Not as a gift&mdash;for Adam immediately
recognized her <em>as a part of himself</em>&mdash;(‘this is now
bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh’)&mdash;a companion
and equal, not one hair’s breadth beneath him in
the majesty and glory of her moral being; not placed
under his authority as a <em>subject</em>, but by his side, on
the same platform of human rights, under the government
of God only. This idea of woman’s being
‘the last best gift of God to man,’ however pretty it
may sound to the ears of those who love to discourse
upon ‘the poetry of romantic gallantry, and the generous
promptings of chivalry,’ has nevertheless been
the means of sinking her from an <em>end</em> into a mere
<em>means</em>&mdash;of turning her into an <em>appendage</em> to man, instead
of recognizing her as <em>a part of man</em>&mdash;of destroying
her individuality, and rights, and responsibilities,
and merging her moral being in that of man.
Instead of <em>Jehovah</em> being <em>her</em> king, <em>her</em> lawgiver, and
<em>her</em> judge, she has been taken out of the exalted
scale of existence in which He placed her, and subjected
to the despotic control of man.</p>

<p>I have often been amused at the vain efforts made
to define the rights and responsibilities of immortal
beings as <em>men</em> and <em>women</em>. No one has yet found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
out just <em>where</em> the line of separation between them
should be drawn, and for this simple reason, that no
one knows just how far below man woman is, whether
she be a head shorter in her moral responsibilities, or
head and shoulders, or the full length of his noble stature,
below him, i.e. under his feet. Confusion, uncertainty,
and great inconsistencies, must exist on this
point, so long as woman is regarded in the least degree
inferior to man; but place her where her Maker
placed her, on the same high level of human rights
with man, side by side with him, and difficulties vanish,
the mountains of perplexity flow down at the presence
of this grand equalizing principle. Measure
her rights and duties by the unerring standard of
<em>moral being</em>, not by the false weights and measures
of a mere circumstance of her human existence, and
then the truth will be self-evident, that whatever it is
<em>morally</em> right for a man to do, it is <em>morally</em> right for a
woman to do. I recognize no rights but <em>human</em> rights&mdash;I
know nothing of men’s rights and women’s rights;
for in Christ Jesus, there is neither male nor female.
It is my solemn conviction, that, until this principle of
equality is recognised and embodied in practice, the
church can do nothing effectual for the permanent reformation
of the world. Woman was the first transgressor,
and the first victim of power. In all heathen
nations, she has been the slave of man, and
Christian nations have never acknowledged her rights.
Nay more, no Christian denomination or Society has
ever acknowledged them on the broad basis of humanity.
I know that in some denominations, she is
permitted to preach the gospel; not from a conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of her rights, nor upon the ground of her equality
as a <em>human being</em>, but of her equality in spiritual gifts&mdash;for
we find that woman, even in these Societies, is
allowed no voice in framing the Discipline by which
she is to be governed. Now, I believe it is woman’s
right to have a voice in all the laws and regulations
by which she is to be <em>governed</em>, whether in Church
or State; and that the present arrangements of society,
on these points, are <em>a violation of human rights</em>,
<em>a rank usurpation of power</em>, a violent seizure and
confiscation of what is sacredly and inalienably hers&mdash;thus
inflicting upon woman outrageous wrongs,
working mischief incalculable in the social circle, and
in its influence on the world producing only evil, and
that continually. <em>If</em> Ecclesiastical and Civil governments
are ordained of God, <em>then</em> I contend that
woman has just as much right to sit in solemn counsel
in Conventions, Conferences, Associations and
General Assemblies, as man&mdash;just as much right to
sit upon the throne of England, or in the Presidential
chair of the United States.</p>

<p>Dost thou ask me, if I would wish to see woman
engaged in the contention and strife of sectarian controversy,
or in the intrigues of political partizans? I
say no! never&mdash;never. I rejoice that she does not
stand on the same platform which man now occupies
in these respects; but I mourn, also, that he should
thus prostitute his higher nature, and vilely cast
away his birthright. I prize the purity of <em>his</em> character
as highly as I do that of hers. As a moral being,
<em>whatever it is morally wrong for her to do, it is
morally wrong for him to do</em>. The fallacious doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of male and female virtues has well nigh ruined
all that is morally great and lovely in his character:
he has been quite as deep a sufferer by it as
woman, though mostly in different respects and by
other processes. As my time is engrossed by the
pressing responsibilities of daily public duty, I have
no leisure for that minute detail which would be required
for the illustration and defence of these principles.
Thou wilt find a wide field opened before thee,
in the investigation of which, I doubt not, thou wilt
be instructed. Enter this field, and explore it: thou
wilt find in it a hid treasure, more precious than rubies&mdash;a
fund, a mine of principles, as new as they are
great and glorious.</p>

<p>Thou sayest, ‘an ignorant, a narrow-minded, or a
stupid woman, cannot feel nor understand the rationality,
the propriety, or the beauty of this relation’&mdash;i.e.
subordination to man. Now, verily, it does appear
to me, that nothing but a narrow-minded view of the
subject of human rights and responsibilities can induce
any one to believe in <em>this subordination to a fallible</em>
being. Sure I am, that the signs of the times
clearly indicate a vast and rapid change in public sentiment,
on this subject. Sure I am that she is not to
be, as she has been, ‘<em>a mere second-hand agent</em>’ in
the regeneration of a fallen world, but the acknowledged
equal and co-worker with man in this glorious
work. Not that ‘she will carry her measures by
tormenting when she cannot please, or by petulant
complaints or obtrusive interference, in matters which
are out of her sphere, and which she cannot comprehend.’
But just in proportion as her moral and intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
capacities become enlarged, she will rise
higher and higher in the scale of creation, until she
reaches that elevation prepared for her by her Maker,
and upon whose summit she was originally stationed,
only ‘a little lower than the angels.’ Then will it
be seen that nothing which concerns the well-being
of mankind is either beyond her sphere, or above her
comprehension: <em>Then</em> will it be seen ‘that America
will be distinguished above all other nations for well
educated women, and for the influence they will exert
on the general interests of society.’</p>

<p>But I must close with recommending to thy perusal,
my sister’s Letters on the Province of Woman,
published in the New England Spectator, and republished
by Isaac Knapp of Boston. As she has taken
up this subject so fully, I have only glanced at it.
That thou and all my country-women may better understand
the true dignity of woman, is the sincere
desire of</p>

<span class="smaller">MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS,&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Holliston</span>, Mass., <i>10th month, 23d, 1837</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>: I resume my pen, to gather up
a few fragments of thy Essay, that have not yet been
noticed, and in love to bid thee farewell.</p>

<p>Thou appearest to think, that it is peculiarly the duty
of <em>women</em> to educate the little children of this nation.
But why, I would ask&mdash;why are they any more bound to
engage in this sacred employment, than men? I believe,
that as soon as the rights of women are understood,
our brethren will see and feel that it is their
duty to co-operate with us, in this high and holy vocation,
of training up little children in the way they
should go. And the very fact of their mingling in
intercourse with such guileless and gentle spirits, will
tend to soften down the asperities of their characters,
and clothe them with the noblest and sublimest Christian
virtues. I know that this work is deemed beneath
the dignity of man; but how great the error!
I once heard a man, who had labored extensively
among children, say, ‘I never feel so near heaven, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
when I am teaching these little ones.’ He was right;
and I trust the time is coming, when the occupation of
an instructer to children will be deemed the most
honorable of human employment. If it is drudgery
to teach these little ones, then it is the duty of men
to bear a part of that burthen; if it is a privilege and
an honor, then we generously invite them to share
that honor and privilege with us.</p>

<p>I know some noble instances of this union of
principles and employment, and am fully settled in
the belief, that abolition doctrines are pre-eminently
calculated to qualify men and women to become
faithful and efficient teachers. <em>They alone</em> teach fully
the doctrine of human rights; and to know and appreciate
these, is an indispensable prerequisite to the
wisely successful performance of the duties of a
teacher. The right understanding of these will qualify
her to teach the fundamental, but unfashionable doctrine,
that ‘God is no respecter of persons,’ and that
he that despiseth the colored man, because he is ‘guilty
of a skin not colored like our own,’ reproacheth
his Maker for having given him that ebon hue. I
consider it absolutely indispensable, that this truth
should be sedulously instilled into the mind of every
child in our republic. I know of <em>no</em> moral truth of
greater importance at the present crisis. Those teachers,
who are not prepared to teach <em>this in all its fullness</em>,
are deficient in one of the most sterling elements
of moral character, and are false to the holy trust
committed to them, and utterly unfit to train up the
children of <em>this</em> generation. So far from urging the
deficiency of teachers in this country, as a reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
women should keep out of the anti-slavery excitement,
I would say to my sisters, if you wish to become pre-eminently
qualified for the discharge of your arduous
duties, come into the abolition ranks, enter this high
school of morals, and drink from the deep fountains of
philanthropy and Christian equality, whence the waters
of healing are welling forth over wide desert wastes,
and making glad the city of our God. Intellectual endowments
are <em>good</em>, but a high standard of moral
principle is <em>better</em>, is <em>essential</em>. As a nation, we have
too long educated the <em>mind</em>, and left the <em>heart</em> a moral
waste. We have fully and fearfully illustrated the
truth of the Apostle’s declaration: ‘Knowledge puffeth
up.’ We have indeed been puffed up, vaunting ourselves
in our mental endowments and national greatness.
But we are beginning to realize, that it is
‘Righteousness which exalteth a nation.’</p>

<p>Thou sayest, when a woman is asked to sign a petition,
or join an Anti-Slavery Society, it is ‘for the
purpose of contributing her measure of influence to
keep up agitation in Congress, to promote the excitement
of the North against the iniquities of the South,
to coerce the South by fear, shame, anger, and a sense
of odium, to do what she is determined not to do.’
Indeed! Are these the only motives presented to the
daughters of America, for laboring in the glorious
cause of Human Rights? Let us examine them.
1. ‘To keep up agitation in Congress.’ Yes&mdash;for I
can adopt this language of Moore of Virginia, in the
Legislature of that State, in 1832: ‘I should regret
at all times the existence of any unnecessary excitement
in the country on any subject; but I confess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I see no reason to lament that which may have arisen
on the present occasion. It is often necessary that
there should be some excitement among the people,
to induce them to turn their attention to questions
deeply affecting the welfare of the Commonwealth;
and <em>there never can arise any subject more worthy
their attention, than that of the abolition of slavery</em>.’
2. ‘To promote the excitement of the North against
the iniquities of the South.’ Yes, and against her
own sinful copartnership in those iniquities. I
believe the discussion of Human Rights at the North
has already been of incalculable advantage to this
country. It is producing the happiest influence upon
the minds and hearts of those who are engaged in it;
just such results as Thomas Clarkson tells us, were
produced in England by the agitation of the subject
there. Says he, ‘Of the immense advantages of this
contest, I know not how to speak. Indeed, the very
agitation of the question, which it involved, has been
highly important. Never was the heart of man so
expanded; never were its generous sympathies so
generally and so perseveringly excited. These sympathies,
thus called into existence, have been useful
preservatives of national virtue.’ I, therefore, wish
very much to promote the Anti-Slavery excitement
at the North, because I believe it will prove a useful
preservative of national virtue. 3. ‘To coerce the
South by fear, shame, anger, and a sense of odium.’
It is true, that I feel the imminent danger of the
South so much, that I would fain ‘save them with
fear, pulling them out of the fire;’ for, if they ever
are saved, they will indeed be ‘as a brand plucked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
out of the burning.’ Nor do I see any thing
wrong in influencing slaveholders by a feeling of
shame and odium, as well as by a sense of guilt.
Why may not abolitionists speak some things <em>to their
shame</em>, as the Apostle did to the Corinthians? As to
anger, it is no design of ours to excite so wicked a
passion. We cannot help it, if, in rejecting the truth,
they become angry. Could Stephen help the anger
of the Jews, when ‘they gnashed upon him with
their teeth’?</p>

<p>But I had thought the principal motives urged by
abolitionists were not these; but that they endeavored
to excite men and women to active exertion,&mdash;first, to
cleanse <em>their own</em> hands of the sin of slavery, and
secondly, to save the South, if possible, and the North,
at any rate, from the impending judgments of heaven.
The result of their mission in this country, cannot
in the least affect the validity of that mission. Like
Noah, they may preach in vain; if so, the destruction
of the South can no more be attributed to them,
than the destruction of the antediluvian world to
him. ‘In vain,’ did I say? Oh no! The discussion
of the rights of the slave has opened the way
for the discussion of <em>other rights</em>, and the ultimate
result will most certainly be, ‘the breaking of <em>every</em>
yoke,’ the letting the oppressed of <em>every</em> grade and
description go free,&mdash;an emancipation far more glorious
than any the world has ever yet seen,&mdash;an introduction
into that ‘liberty wherewith Christ hath made
his people free.’</p>

<p>I will now say a few words on thy remarks about
Esther. Thou sayest, ‘When a woman is placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
similar circumstances, where death to herself and all
her nation is one alternative, and there is nothing
worse to fear, but something to hope as the other alternative,
then she may safely follow such an example.’
In this sentence, thou hast conceded every
thing I could wish, and proved beyond dispute just
what I adduced this text to prove in my Appeal. I
will explain myself. Look at the condition of our
country&mdash;Church and State deeply involved in the
enormous crime of slavery: ah! more&mdash;claiming
the sacred volume, as our charter for the collar and
chain. What then can we expect, but that the vials
of divine wrath will be poured out upon a nation of
oppressors and hypocrites? for we are loud in our
professions of civil and ecclesiastical liberty. Now,
as a Southerner, I know that reflecting slaveholders
expect their peculiar institution to be overthrown in
blood. Read the opinion of Moore of Virginia, as
expressed by him in the House of Delegates in 1832:&mdash;‘What
must be the ultimate consequence of retaining
the slaves amongst us? The answer to this enquiry
is both obvious and appalling. It is, that <em>the
time will come, and at no distant day, when we shall
be involved in all the horrors of a servile war</em>, which
will not end until both sides have suffered much, until
the land shall everywhere be red with blood, and
until the slaves or the whites are totally exterminated.
If there be any truth in history, and if the time
has not arrived when causes have ceased to produce
their legitimate results, the dreadful catastrophe in
which I have predicted that our slave system must
result, if persisted in, <em>is as inevitable as any event
which has already transpired</em>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, then, is one alternative, and just as tremendous
an alternative as that which was presented to
the Queen of Persia. ‘There is <em>nothing worse</em> to
fear’ for the South, let the results of abolition efforts
be what they may, whilst ‘there is something to hope
as the other alternative;’ because if she will receive
the truth in the love of it, she may repent and be
saved. So that, after all, according to thy own reasoning,
the women of America ‘may safely follow
such an example.’</p>

<p>After endeavoring to show that woman has no
moral right to exercise the right of petition for the
dumb and stricken slave; no business to join, in any
way, in the excitement which anti-slavery principles
are producing in our country; no business to join
abolition societies, &amp;c. &amp;c.; thou professest to tell our
sisters what they are to do, in order to bring the system
of slavery to an end. And now, my dear friend,
what does all that thou hast said in many pages,
amount to? Why, that women are to exert their influence
in private life, to allay the excitement which
exists on this subject, and to quench the flame of sympathy
in the hearts of their fathers, husbands, brothers
and sons. Fatal delusion! Will Christian women
heed such advice?</p>

<p>Hast thou ever asked thyself, what the slave would
think of thy book, if he could read it? Dost thou
know that, from the beginning to the end, not a word
of compassion for <em>him</em> has fallen from thy pen? Recall,
I pray, the memory of the hours which thou
spent in writing it! Was the paper once moistened
by the tear of pity? Did thy heart once swell with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
deep sympathy for thy sister <em>in bonds</em>? Did it once
ascend to God in broken accents for the deliverance
of the captive? Didst thou ever ask thyself, what
the free man of color would think of it? Is it such
an exhibition of slavery and prejudice, as will call
down <em>his</em> blessing upon thy head? Hast thou thought
of <em>these</em> things? or carest thou not for the blessings
and the prayers of these our suffering brethren?
Consider, I entreat, the reception given to thy book
by the apologists of slavery. What meaneth that
loud acclaim with which they hail it? Oh, listen and
weep, and let thy repentings be kindled together, and
speedily bring forth, I beseech thee, fruits meet for
repentance, and henceforth show thyself faithful to
Christ and his bleeding representative the slave.</p>

<p>I greatly fear that thy book might have been written
just as well, hadst thou not had the heart of a
woman. It bespeaks a superior intellect, but paralyzed
and spell-bound by the sorcery of a worldly-minded
expediency. Where, oh where, in its pages, are the
outpourings of a soul overwhelmed with a sense of
the heinous crimes of our nation, and the necessity of
immediate repentance? Farewell! Perhaps on a
dying bed thou mayest vainly wish that ‘<cite>Miss Beecher
on the Slave Question</cite>’ might perish with the
mouldering hand which penned its cold and heartless
pages. But I forbear, and in deep sadness of heart,
but in tender love though I thus speak, I bid thee again,
Farewell. Forgive me, if I have wronged thee, and
pray for her who still feels like</p>

<p>Thy sister in the bonds of a common sisterhood,</p>

<p class="signature">A. E. GRIMKÉ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>P. S. Since preparing the foregoing letters for the
press, I have been informed by a Bookseller in Providence,
that some of thy books had been sent to him
to sell last summer, and that one afternoon a number
of southerners entered his store whilst they were
lying on the counter. An elderly lady took up one
of them and after turning over the pages for some
time, she threw it down and remarked, here is a book
written by the daughter of a northern dough face, to
apologize for our southern institutions&mdash;but for my
part, I have a thousand times more respect for the
Abolitionists, who openly denounce the system of
slavery, than for those people, who in order to please
us, cloak their real sentiments under such a garb as
this. This southern lady, I have no doubt, expressed
the sentiments of thousands of the most respectable
slaveholders in our country&mdash;and thus, they will tell
the North in bitter reproach for their sinful subserviency,
after the lapse of a few brief years, when interest
no longer padlocks their lips. At present the
South feels that she must at least <em>appear</em> to thank her
northern apologists.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
